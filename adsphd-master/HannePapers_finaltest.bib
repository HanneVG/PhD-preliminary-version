  abstract = {Risks of dry and wet sowing methods of rainfed barley were evaluated in northern Ethiopia. The evaluation was based on yield simulation using a validated AquaCrop model. Risks of failure (false start) were assessed by taking biomass threshold levels (\&lt;0.1 t ha-1) from defined early, normal and late sowing by farmer's and depth criterion over long-term (21\textendash{}41 years) climate observation. The study verified that false start increased over the study area in the order from southwest to southeast and northeast. The risk level due to false start by farmer's criterion ranged from 5 to 37\%, 9 to 37\%, and 9 to 19\% for early, normal and late sowing, respectively, whereas the false start risk by depth criterion ranged from 14 to 29\% for early; 14 to 24\% for normal; and 5 to 23\% for late sowing. The long-term simulated average yield across the stations ranged from 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.8 to 1.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 t ha-1 for early, 0.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 to 1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.5 t ha-1 for normal and 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 to 1.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 t ha-1 for late sowing when farmer's criterion was applied whereas the corresponding average yield when depth criteria was applied ranged from 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 to 1.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 t ha-1 for early, 0.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 to 1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 t ha-1 for normal and 0.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 to 1.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 t ha-1 for late sowing. The result suggested that risks of false start reduced and barley yield relatively improved when normal/late sowing was applied based on farmer's criterion or when early/normal sowing was applied based on depth criterion. In most of the cases, stations situated southwest of the catchment were characterized by early onset and late cessation (longer length of growing period) whereas stations situated towards the northeast, northwest and southeast are more characterized by normal or late onset and early or normal cessation (shorter growing period). In general, yield reduced from west to east mainly due to the effect of onset and cessation of rain. This study also showed that weed infestation was prevalent when early sowing was applied. Thus to minimize the risk of false start and to reduce cost of weeding, sowing should be scheduled after sufficient moisture is ensured during which especially grass weeds would emerge before sowing so that the emerged weeds could be plowed over.},

  abstract = {Recent research on crop-water relations has increasingly been directed towards the application of locally acquired knowledge to answering the questions raised on larger scales. However, the application of the local results to larger scales is often questionable. This paper presents a GIS-based tool, or a GEPIC model, to estimate crop water productivity (CWP) on the land surface with spatial resolution of 30 arc-min. The GEPIC model can estimate CWP on a large-scale by considering the local variations in climate, soil and management conditions. The results show a non-linear relationship between virtual water content (or the inverse of CWP) and crop yield. The simulated CWP values are generally more sensitive to three parameters, i.e. potential harvest index for a crop under ideal growing conditions (HI), biomass-energy ratio indicating the energy conversion to biomass (WA), and potential heat unit accumulation from emergence to maturity (PHU), than other parameters. The GEPIC model is a useful tool to study crop-water relations on large scales with high spatial resolution; hence, it can be used to support large-scale decision making in water management and crop production.},

However, their management cannot be analyzed independently of weather, soil characteristics, field hydrology, crop characteristics, crop rotation, and management factors. This paper describes the water, nitrogen, and crop growth components of CropSyst, a comprehensive cropping systems simulation model, and provides preliminary verification of these components. The water budget of the model properly describes crop water use. Predicted nitrogen contents throughout the soil profile did not exactly match the measured values from leaching experiments, but they did follow the general trends of the data. The agreement between simulated and observed biomass and yield of corn, winter wheat and spring wheat grown in two locations with a total of 77 data points was good as shown by several statistical indicators. Based on this preliminary validation, CropSyst appears promising as a tool to analyze management practices for water and nitrogen. Additional validation of model components, including a wide range of crops and conditions, should be conducted in the future.},

  issn = {1531-0361},

  abstract = {The AquaCrop model clarifies the effects of water on crop yield and is a useful tool for improving farm-level water management and optimizing water use efficiency. AquaCrop is a water-driven simulation model that requires a relatively low number of parameters and input data to simulate the yield response to water of most of the major field and vegetable crops cultivated worldwide. Although the model is simple, it pays particular attention to the fundamental processes involved in crop productivity and in the responses to water, from a physiological and agronomic perspective. Good agreement was obtained by AquaCrop in simulating wheat yields under full irrigation. The experiment was conducted with 10 varieties (DBW 17, RAJ 4120, PBW 621, K 0307, HD 2733, HD 2687, CBW 38, DBW 39, HD 2985 and PBW 343) of wheat during 2008\textendash{}2009 and 2009\textendash{}2010 at the farm of Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya at Majhian located in Dakshin Dinajpur District of West Bengal, India, during December to April, and growth stages and production were simulated using the AquaCrop model for the best variety. The model simulated wheat yield as 4.16\,t\,ha-1as compared to the actual yield of 4.10\,t\,ha-1 in the year 2008\textendash{}2009. The model was validated in 2009\textendash{}2010 for simulating wheat yield and performance of the model was quite satisfactory. The model simulated 4.01\,t\,ha-1 as compared to the actual yield of 3.90\,t\,ha-1. The model did not perform very well for the validation period. The simplicity of AquaCrop in its required minimum input data, which are readily available or can easily be collected, makes it user-friendly. It is also a very useful model for scenario simulations and for planning purposes to be used by economists, water administrators and managers working in West Bengal, India.

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2014.07.028},
  abstract = {The impact of climate change on cotton yields in seven main arable crop sites in Greece (Agrinio, Alexandroupoli, Arta, Karditsa, Mikra, Pyrgos, Yliki) was investigated. The FAO AquaCrop (v.4) water driven model was used as a crop growth simulation tool under eight climatic models (HadRM3, C4I, REMO-MPI, ETHZ, CNRM, DMI-HIRHAM, KNMI, SMHI) based on IPPC's A1B emission scenario. The mean values of the models ensemble for temperature were +1.8 \ensuremath{^\circ}C until 2050 and +4 \ensuremath{^\circ}C until the end of the century. The respective values for precipitation were -11\% and -24\%. The research was applied over three periods, 1961\textendash{}1990, 2021\textendash{}2050 and 2071\textendash{}2100. AquaCrop was calibrated for 2006 and validated for 2005 and 2007 using the field data from the experiments carried out in Karditsa (Central Greece). Root Mean Square Error for yield and biomass was 0.17 and 0.49 t/ha, respectively, while Index of Agreement was 0.93 and 0.94. AquaCrop was run using the Growing Degree Day mode in order to account better for the temperature variations. However, it gave erratic results for some specific climatic models (SMHI, KNMI, CNRM) in some years within the period 1961\textendash{}1990. A tendency towards increasing yields by the end of the century was detected for the majority of the climate models, especially in Western Greece (Arta, Agrinio, Pyrgos) and Northern Greece (Mikra, Alexandroupoli). The efficiency of the eight models for yield predictions in the seven sites was assessed by means of a discriminant function analysis. On the account of their function coefficients over the seven sites, it was found that the models DMI and C4I explained consistently a great proportion of variation among the three time periods whereas the models ETHZ, SMHI and KNMI were more efficient only in the periods 1961\textendash{}1990, 2021\textendash{}2050 and 2071\textendash{}2099, respectively. By running the models DMI and C4I the relative impacts of climate change on seedcotton yield in the different areas were predicted and the results were discussed on the account of the corresponding changes in precipitation, temperature and crop evapotranspiration. These results will be useful for future irrigation planning in the study areas.},

  abstract = {Empirical validation is the comparison of model predictions with observations from the real system, together with an assessment of whether the model is adequate for its purpose. When the data available consist of pairs of predictions and observations covering the range of model operation, they are often presented as a scatter graph, sometimes with a regression line added. There are several reasons why regression is not appropriate for this task. An alternative method described uses the deviations (prediction minus observation) plotted against the observations. From this graph of deviations the bias and precision of the model can be assessed, and how they vary along the range of operation. The two criteria for adequacy of the model are the envelope of acceptable precision and the proportion of points that must lie within it. The envelope of acceptable precision is defined with reference to the purpose of the model, most commonly by comparison with the precision of the observations. The proportion of points in the envelope can be set at 0.95 by analogy with confidence limits. This method is demonstrated on two examples from different models, and it can be extended to other forms of validation data. Although statistical tests are not involved, which avoids the problem of satisfying assumptions, this method is simple, objective and quantitative and can be made rigorous by definition of the criteria in advance.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2015.10.013},
  abstract = {In semi-arid environments vegetation density and distribution is of considerable importance for the hydrological water balance. A number of hydrological models exploit Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps retrieved by remote sensing as a measure of the vegetation cover, in order to enhance the evaluation of evapotranspiration and interception losses.

On the other hand, actual evapotranspiration and vegetation development can be derived through crop growth models, such as AquaCrop, developed by FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), which allows the simulation of the canopy development of the main field crops. We used MODIS LAI images to calibrate AquaCrop according to the canopy cover development of winter wheat. With this aim we exploited an empirical relationship between LAI and canopy cover. In detail Aquacrop was calibrated with MODIS LAI maps collected between 2008 and 2011, and validated with reference to MODIS LAI maps of 2013\textendash{}2014 in Rocchetta Sant'Antonio and Sant'Agata, two test sites in the Carapelle watershed, Southern Italy. Results, in terms of evaluation of canopy cover, provided improvements. For example, for Rocchetta Sant'Antonio, the statistical indexes varyfrom r = 0.40, ER = 0.22, RMSE = 17.28 and KGE = 0.31 (using the model without calibration), to r = 0.86, ER = 0.08, RMSE = 6.01 and KGE 0.85 (after calibration).},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on cotton yields in seven main arable crop sites in Greece (Agrinio, Alexandroupoli, Arta, Karditsa, Mikra, Pyrgos, Yliki) was investigated. The FAO AquaCrop (v.4) water driven model was used as a crop growth simulation tool under eight climatic models (HadRM3, C4I, REMO-MPI, ETHZ, CNRM, DMI-HIRHAM, KNMI, SMHI) based on IPPC's A1B emission scenario. The mean values of the models ensemble for temperature were +1.8 \ensuremath{^\circ}C until 2050 and +4 \ensuremath{^\circ}C until the end of the century. The respective values for precipitation were -11\% and -24\%. The research was applied over three periods, 1961\textendash{}1990, 2021\textendash{}2050 and 2071\textendash{}2100. AquaCrop was calibrated for 2006 and validated for 2005 and 2007 using the field data from the experiments carried out in Karditsa (Central Greece). Root Mean Square Error for yield and biomass was 0.17 and 0.49 t/ha, respectively, while Index of Agreement was 0.93 and 0.94. AquaCrop was run using the Growing Degree Day mode in order to account better for the temperature variations. However, it gave erratic results for some specific climatic models (SMHI, KNMI, CNRM) in some years within the period 1961\textendash{}1990. A tendency towards increasing yields by the end of the century was detected for the majority of the climate models, especially in Western Greece (Arta, Agrinio, Pyrgos) and Northern Greece (Mikra, Alexandroupoli). The efficiency of the eight models for yield predictions in the seven sites was assessed by means of a discriminant function analysis. On the account of their function coefficients over the seven sites, it was found that the models DMI and C4I explained consistently a great proportion of variation among the three time periods whereas the models ETHZ, SMHI and KNMI were more efficient only in the periods 1961\textendash{}1990, 2021\textendash{}2050 and 2071\textendash{}2099, respectively. By running the models DMI and C4I the relative impacts of climate change on seedcotton yield in the different areas were predicted and the results were discussed on the account of the corresponding changes in precipitation, temperature and crop evapotranspiration. These results will be useful for future irrigation planning in the study areas.},

We recognize that at present, such a review remains, in part, speculative, and more illustrative than definitive. However, recent events on the global stage, particularly in regard to the number of food riots that occurred during 2008, even at a time of record harvests, have prompted additional interest in those factors, including invasive species, which could, through climatic uncertainty, alter food production. To that end, as agricultural scientists, we wish to begin an initial evaluation of key questions related to food production and climate change including: how vulnerable is agriculture to invasive species?; are current pest management strategies sufficient to control invasive outbreaks in the future?; what are the knowledge gaps?; can we provide initial recommendations for scientists, land managers and policy makers in regard to available resources? Our overall goals are to begin a synthesis of potential impacts on productivity, to identify seminal research areas that can be addressed in future research, and to provide the scientific basis to allow agronomists and land managers to formulate mitigation and adaptation options regarding invasive species and climate change as a means to maintain food security.},

  volume = {6},
  shorttitle = {Deficit irrigation practices as alternative means of improving water use efficiencies in irrigated agriculture},
  abstract = {Deficit irrigation is becoming an important strategy to reduce agricultural water use in arid and semiarid
regions. A field experiment was conducted in 2007 to examine the effect of deficit irrigation on the
yield performance of maize crop under Arba Minch (Ethiopia) condition. Based on four phonological
growth stages (establishment, vegetative, flowering and grain-filling stages) of maize, the crop was
subjected to water deficit during one, two or three growth stages. The highest yield obtained was 5.933
tons/ha and the lowest was 3.467 tons/ha. Treatments that were water stressed during single growth
stages such as first and second as well as consecutively during two stages, that is, first and second
growth stages produced yields that are not significantly different from the yield achieved under fully
irrigated treatment. Compared to the maximum yield, 29 to 42\% lower yields were registered under
treatments that were subjected to water deficit during three growth stages. Not only frequency of water
deficit periods but also its timing was found to have effect on the final yield. Treatments which were
stressed during two growth stages had 2.2 (0011) to 38.5\% (1010) yield reduction compared to the
maximum yield. The highest yield reduction was observed under the treatment which was irrigated only
during the fourth growth stage (0001), followed by treatment irrigated during first and third growth
stages (1010) and then treatments irrigated only during second stage (0100). This shows that prolonged
deficit over three growing stages will have more yield reduction impacts. Plots stressed during third
and fourth growth stages were found to produce lower yields indicating the severe effects of water
stress during flowering (tasseling and silking) and early grain-filling stages on yield. The comparison of
water savings achieved under different treatments that had no significant differences in yield level from
full irrigated plot (1111I) ranged from 18.2\% (treatments 0111 and 1011) to 36.4\% (0011). This indicates
that water deficit during first and second growth stages had no significant effect on the grain yield of
corn and it is worthwhile to save irrigation water under this condition. The water use efficiency
increased with decreasing water supply and increasing yield level. Irrigation water use efficiency
increased with decreasing water supply and related yield which may not be desirable from farmers'
perspective.},

  abstract = {Under low and poorly distributed rainfall higher food production can be achieved by increasing crop water use efficiency (WUE) through optimum soil fertility management and selection of deep-rooting cultivars, appropriate plant density and planting dates. We explored AquaCrop's applicability in selecting adaptive practices for improving maize yield and WUE under rainfed smallholder farming in semi-arid Zimbabwe. AquaCrop was first tested using field measurements without calibration. The model was subsequently applied to estimate the effect of effective rooting depth (ERD), plant density and planting date on maize yield. Simulations were done with daily rainfall data for 25 seasons. During model testing AquaCrop simulated canopy cover development well and simulated biomass accumulation showed good agreement with measured values. The model overestimated soil water, and observed final biomass and grain yield were 96 and 92\% of simulated values, respectively. Model application showed that increasing ERD from 0.40 m at 32,500 plants ha-1 to 0.60 m at 44,400 plants ha-1 increased grain yield from 6.0 to 7.8 t ha-1, biomass water use efficiency by 20.5\%, grain water use efficiency by 23.6\% and transpiration water use efficiency by 26.8\%. At 0.60 and 0.80 m ERD and 44,400 plants ha-1, biomass and grain yield, and WUE, were similar. Drainage below the rootzone was \ensuremath{\geq}40\% of non-productive water losses in normal and wet seasons whilst soil evaporation contributed 47\% in dry seasons at 0.80 m ERD. To improve yield and WUE, we recommend: incorporation of deep-rooting legumes, deeper-rooting cultivars (\ensuremath{\geq}0.60 m effective rooting depth) and practices that improve ERD, a plant density of 44,400 plants ha-1; and practices that reduce soil evaporation e.g. mulching and addition of organic fertilisers to improve soils' available water capacity and enhance response to mineral fertilisers. Further research should include field testing of results from this study with farmers.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement (IWR) and yield for rainfed rice and irrigated paddy, respectively, at Ngamoeyeik Irrigation Project in Myanmar. Climate projections from two General Circulation Models, namely ECHAM5 and HadCM3 were derived for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The climate variables were downscaled to basin level by using the Statistical DownScaling Model. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the yield and IWR under future climate. The analysis shows a decreasing trend in maximum temperature for three scenarios and three time windows considered; however, an increasing trend is observed for minimum temperature for all cases. The analysis on precipitation also suggests that rainfall in wet season is expected to vary largely from -29 to +21.9\% relative to the baseline period. A higher variation is observed for the rainfall in dry season ranging from -42\% for 2080s, and +96\% in the case of 2020s. A decreasing trend of IWR is observed for irrigated paddy under the three scenarios indicating that small irrigation schemes are suitable to meet the requirements. An increasing trend in the yield of rainfed paddy was estimated under climate change demonstrating increased food security in the region.},

  abstract = {Following the Integrated Water Resources Management approach, the European Water Framework Directive demands Member States to develop water management plans at the catchment level. Those plans have to integrate the different interests and must be developed with stakeholder participation. To face these requirements, managers need tools to assess the impacts of possible management alternatives on natural and socio-economic systems. These tools should ideally be able to address the complexity and uncertainties of the water system, while serving as a platform for stakeholder participation. The objective of our research was to develop a participatory integrated assessment model, based on the combination of a crop model, an economic model and a participatory Bayesian network, with an application in the middle Guadiana sub-basin, in Spain. The methodology is intended to capture the complexity of water management problems, incorporating the relevant sectors, as well as the relevant scales involved in water management decision making. The integrated model has allowed us testing different management, market and climate change scenarios and assessing the impacts of such scenarios on the natural system (crops), on the socio-economic system (farms) and on the environment (water resources). Finally, this integrated assessment modelling process has allowed stakeholder participation, complying with the main requirements of current European water laws.},

A histogram-based threshold technique was used to separate green vegetation tissues from background soil and residue materials in order to derive the canopy vertical gap fraction from the digital photos. The results show that the gap fraction obtained using digital photography was linearly related with the diffuse non-interceptance obtained with a LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (R2 = 0.78). LAI derived from the photographic method was comparable to the LAI measured using LAI-2000 (R2 = 0.83) in the absence of senescence. We recommend using digital photography in addition to conventional equipment for acquiring LAI and gap fraction of agricultural crops, because the approach is less limited by radiation conditions, and the protocol can easily be implemented for extensive sampling at low cost.},

  abstract = {ALMANAC is a dynamic model for plant growth, water balance and soil nitrogen dynamics that can simulate on a daily basis two or more competing species. The simulation of competition for light is based on Beer's law, allowing a different extinction coefficient (k) for each species. Light is partitioned between species based on k-values, leaf area index and plant heights. Total hiomass is simulated with radiation use efficiency and grain yield with a harvest index approach, sensitive to water stress. The model simulates competition for water and nutrients based on each species current rooting zone and demand by each species. The effect of crop management on the competition issue can he simulated. The model was evaluated in Dijon (France) using 4 years of experimental data on wheat:oat mixtures, differing in oat (Avena sativa L.) densities, the period of oat emergence, the date of weed suppression by herbicides and the wheat (Triticun aestivum L.) genotype. Additional data on oilseed rape (Brassica nupus L.) and vetch (Vilcia sauiva L.) competition in spring wheat were also used. The wheat grain yield was reasonably simulated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.10-0.35 t ha-1. Corresponding values for oats were 0.10-0.55 t ha-1. The competitiveness of oats, oilseed rape and vetch was correctly simulated. The model appears as a reasonable tool for estimating damage thresholds in integrated weed control programmes.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0378-3774(00)00128-1},
  abstract = {Rice production in Asia needs to increase to feed a growing population whereas water for irrigation is getting scarcer. Major challenges are to (i) save water; (ii) increase water productivity and (iii) produce more rice with less water. This study analyzes the ways in which water-saving irrigation can help to meet these challenges at the field level. The analyses are conducted using experimental data collected mostly in central\textendash{}northern India and the Philippines. Water input can be reduced by reducing ponded water depths to soil saturation or by alternate wetting/drying. Water savings under saturated soil conditions were on average 23\% (\ensuremath{\pm}14\%) with yield reductions of only 6\% (\ensuremath{\pm}6\%). Yields were reduced by 10\textendash{}40\% when soil water potentials in the root zone were allowed to reach -100 to -300 mbar. In clayey soils, intermittent drying may lead to shrinkage and cracking, thereby risking increased soil water loss, increased water requirements and decreased water productivity. Water productivity in continuous flooded rice was typically 0.2\textendash{}0.4 g grain per kg water in India and 0.3\textendash{}1.1 g grain per kg water in the Philippines. Water-saving irrigation increases water productivity, up to a maximum of about 1.9 g grain per kg water, but decreases yield. It therefore does not produce more rice with less water on the same field. Field-level water productivity and yield can only be increased concomitantly by improving total factor productivity or by raising the yield potential. Total rice production can be increased by using water saved in one location to irrigate new land in another. If this is not done, a strategy of saving water at the field level potentially threatens total rice production at large.},

  abstract = {In water-limited environments soil water content at sowing is important in determining durum wheat germination, emergence and plant establishment. Soil water content interacts greatly with soil nitrogen content, affecting nitrogen uptake and crop productivity. Simulation models can be used to confirm the optimal strategy by testing several crop management scenarios.

The CERES-Wheat model, previously calibrated and validated in southern Italy, has been used in a seasonal analysis to optimise nitrogen fertilisation of durum wheat at different levels of crop available water (CAW) at planting date in southern Italy. The simulation was carried out for a 48-year period with measured daily climatic data. The 99 simulated scenarios derived from the combinations of different CAW levels at sowing, nitrogen fertiliser rates and application times.

The results obtained from the simulation indicated that the effect of CAW at sowing was relevant for durum wheat production at lowest and highest values, while the optimal sowing time to maximise yield and profit can be considered when CAW is 40\textendash{}60\%. In the case study optimal N fertiliser amount was estimated to be 100\ensuremath{\pm}20 kg ha-1, from a productive, environmental and economic point of view. The nitrogen split application\textemdash{}half at sowing and half at stem extension stage\textemdash{}resulted in the best management practice.

This application of the CERES-Wheat model confirmed the capability of the model to compare several crop management strategies in a typical durum wheat cropping area.},

  abstract = {Severe land degradation affects the livelihood of many farmers in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Various soil and water conservation practices have been proposed to reduce land degradation and to improve the quality of the natural resource base but quantitative information on their agro-ecological effects is often lacking. In this study, effects of three soil and water conservation practices are assessed using a crop growth simulation model (WOFOST), a nutrient monitoring model (NUTMON) and a hydrological erosion model (LISEM), which are applied at field, farm and regional scale, respectively. Evaluated soil and water conservation practices include (i) bunds along field contours to improve water availability for crop production, (ii) mulching of crop residues to improve soil nitrogen stocks and (iii) reforestation to reduce erosion. Data from the watershed Gobo Deguat in northeastern Tigray have been used as a case-study. Bunds slightly increased crop productivity at sowing dates when water-limited yields were low, while productivity decreased at more favorable sowing dates due to the reduction in cropped area required for the construction of bunds. Crop residues used as mulch hardly contributed to lower soil nitrogen depletion at farm level as the total amount of nitrogen in crop residues was limited, while part of the crop residue nitrogen returned to the soil anyway in the form of manure and compost. Reforestation reduced erosion up to 14\% but this is insignificant compared to the sacrifice in cultivated land which needs to be reforested. Applied tools allow rapid ex-ante evaluation of soil and water conservation practices and may contribute to improved cost-benefit analysis of proposed measures, and identification of more appropriate means to combat land degradation. The analyses show important trade-offs and the effects of the assessed soil and water conservation practices may partially explain their low rate of adoption in Tigray.},

These strategies included the combination of two cultivars of different maturity (intermediate and short) and two sowing dates (early and late), in two different locations (Pergamino and Marcos Juarez). In addition, the impact of not controlling weeds during the fallow preceding each crop was assessed. Simulation experiments showed that without limitations of nitrogen, maximum yields could be achieved by early sowing of the intermediate-cycle cultivar. The highest yield achieved by this strategy was partially associated with greater water consumption during the crop cycle. However, in the lowest-yield years of both sites, but particularly in Marcos Juarez, the intermediate cultivar sown early did not appear to be the best option. An analysis of stability of grain yield indicated that late sowing of the short-cycle cultivar was the most stable system. For weedy fallows, the yield of the short-cycle cultivar was more affected than the intermediate one, particularly in years of low yield.},

  abstract = {Agriculture needs to increase its production with a small amount of available fresh water. Deficit irrigation (DI) is now widely been investigated as one of the solutions for this problem. The effects of concentrated drought stress in various phenological stages of quinoa on total production were assessed in above-ground mini-lysimeters under controlled conditions in the Bolivian Altiplano. From the results of the controlled experiment a promising DI strategy was obtained which consisted in mitigating droughts during plant establishment and during the reproductive stage (flowering and early grain filling). The DI strategy was tested in the field by respecting local agricultural practices and compared with full irrigation (FI) and rainfed treatments. The field experiments were conducted in two locations in the central Bolivian Altiplano (Patacamaya and Condoriri) and in two cropping seasons (2005\textendash{}2006, and 2006\textendash{}2007). The performance of quinoa in all experiments was assessed by measuring total seed yield, seed size, harvest index (HI) and water use efficiency (WUE). From the controlled experiment, the negative effect of continuous drought was demonstrated. The milky grain phase was observed as being most sensitive to drought stress, followed by the flowering stage. Drought stress after emergence till the 6-leaf stage and from the 6-leaf stage till the 12-leaf stage did not cause lower yields and resulted in equal or higher WUE than FI. In Condoriri no significant differences were found between the DI and rainfed treatment as a result of the good rainfall distribution during the critical phenological stages. The DI strategy in Patacamaya in 2005\textendash{}2006 resulted in significantly higher yields (2 Mg/ha) and 1000 seed mass (5.5 g) as compared to the rainfed treatment (1.7 Mg/ha and 4.2 g, respectively). The field experiment of 2006\textendash{}2007 indicated that additional irrigation during the late vegetative stage is redundant and that a DI strategy with irrigation only during plant establishment is insufficient. A significant, negative linear relation was demonstrated in the mini-lysimeter and field experiments between pre- and post-anthesis ETa and WUE, indicating the extra harmful character of droughts during flowering and grain filling if the crop did not suffer drought stress before flowering. From the field results, former studies and observations in farmers' fields, indicative values for the net irrigation requirement, expected yields and WUE for various management conditions, irrigation applications and for different types of years were derived. It is believed that quinoa yields can be stabilized at 1.2 up to 2 Mg/ha with the help of DI by applying only half of the irrigation water required for full irrigation.},

  abstract = {Models of agro-ecosystems provide means of prediction beyond the bounds of experience or experimentation. Extrapolation may involve simulation of the expected behaviour for different climate and/or soil conditions, perhaps with alternative management, or for a longer time scale than observed experimentally. The issues to be addressed include those concerned with crop growth and profitability, effects on the soil resource, and consequences for the environment.
The extent to which the model output is credible depends on how well the model represents those aspects of the system that are important for a particular application. In principle, any model can be enhanced to deal with additional factors, but more complex models become increasingly hungry for inputs, and increasingly difficult to test against actual data. There are judgements to be made as to whether the demands of model building/testing can be justified.
The choice of what soil constraints should be included in models will depend on what the model is to be used for and the understanding of the processes that the model purports to represent. The dynamics of water and nitrogen are the soil features commonly represented in crop/forest models. Based particularly on experiences with the APSIM modelling framework, the paper reports developments aimed at dealing with erosion, soil structure, salinisation, acidification, and phosphorus as limitations to plant growth.
Modelling the consequences of global change on crops and forests involves issues of productivity, climatic variability, ``greenhouse'' effects and sustainability. Discussion focuses on whether current models need to be enhanced by including other constraints in order to address such issues.},

  abstract = {Efficient use of rainwater is essential for producing sufficient food crops in semi-arid regions in southern Africa. If rainwater is harvested and channelled to an arable land in a dry area, risk for crop production with variable rainfall due to the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena, can be reduced. Crop modelling is a powerful tool to understand processes of plant growth and development under particular environmental conditions. A crop simulation study was, therefore, carried out to demonstrate El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a effects on maize (Zea mays) yield with a micro-catchment water harvesting (WH) production system in a semi-arid region (Bloemfontein, South Africa). A weather-crop growth model combined with rainfall intensity and runoff models was used to estimate maize yield in the WH production system. The simulation study confirmed that the productivity is greater in La Ni{\~n}a than El Ni{\~n}o tendency years, and under El Ni{\~n}o conditions the highest risk of low yield of maize grown with the WH technique occurs if the crop is planted at higher densities (e.g. 18,000 plants/ha) earlier in the summer growing season (e.g. the first day of November) with a profile empty of soil water at planting.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a pedigree of the crop growth simulation models by the `School of de Wit' is presented. The origins and philosophy of this school are traced from de Wit's classical publication on modelling photosynthesis of leaf canopies in 1965. It is shown how changing research goals and priorities over the years have resulted in the evolution of a pedigree of models that are similar in philosophy but differ in level of complexity, the processes addressed and their functionality. In the beginning, modelling was motivated by the quest for scientific insight and the wish to quantify and integrate biophysical processes to explain the observed variation in crop growth. Later, the emphasis of, and funding for, agricultural research shifted towards putting acquired insights to practical and operational use. Model development became led by a demand for tactical and strategic decision support, yield forecasting, land zonation and explorative scenario studies. Modelling developments for different production situations are illustrated using the models the authors consider most important, i.e. BACROS, SUCROS, WOFOST, MACROS and LINTUL, but reference is also made to other models. Finally, comments are made about the usefulness and applicability of these models after nearly 30 years of development, and some future courses of action are suggested.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11269-013-0341-0},
  abstract = {Water demand for irrigated agriculture is increasing against limited availability of fresh water resources in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River e.g., Khorezm region of Uzbekistan. Future scenarios predict that Khorezm region will receive fewer water supplies due to climate change, transboundary conflicts and hence farmers have to achieve their yield targets with less water. We conducted a study and used AquaCrop model to develop the optimum and deficit irrigation schedule under shallow groundwater conditions (1.0\textendash{}1.2 m) in the study region. Cotton being a strategic crop in the region was used for simulations. Capillary rise substantially contributes to crop-water requirements and is the key characteristic of the regional soils. However, AquaCrop does not simulate capillary rise contribution, thereby HYDRUS-1D model was used in this study for the quantification of capillary rise contribution. Alongside optimal irrigation schedule for cotton, deficit strategies were also derived in two ways: proportional reduction from each irrigation event (scenario-A) throughout the growth period as well as reduced water supply at specific crop growth stages (scenario-B). For scenario-A, 20, 40, 50 and 60 \% of optimal water was deducted from each irrigation quota whereas for scenario-B irrigation events were knocked out at different crop growth stages (stage 1(emergence), stage 2 (vegetative), stage 3 (flowering) and stage 4 (yield formation and ripening)). For scenario-A, 0, 14, 30 and 48 \% of yield reduction was observed respectively. During stress at the late crop development stage, a reduced water supply of 12 \% resulted in a yield increase of 8 \%. Conversely, during stress at the earlier crop development stage, yield loss was 17\textendash{}18 \%. During water stress at the late ripening stage, no yield loss was observed. Results of this study provide guidelines for policy makers to adopt irrigation schedule depending upon availability of irrigation water.},

  abstract = {Integrated hydro-economic models have been widely applied to water management problems in regions of intensive groundwater-fed irrigation. However, policy interpretations may be limited as most existing models do not explicitly consider two important aspects of observed irrigation decision making, namely the limits on instantaneous irrigation rates imposed by well yield and the intraseasonal structure of irrigation planning. We develop a new modeling approach for determining irrigation demand that is based on observed farmer behavior and captures the impacts on production and water use of both well yield and climate. Through a case study of irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains region of the United States we predict optimal irrigation strategies under variable levels of groundwater supply, and assess the limits of existing models for predicting land and groundwater use decisions by farmers. Our results show that irrigation behavior exhibits complex nonlinear responses to changes in groundwater availability. Declining well yields induce large reductions in the optimal size of irrigated area and irrigation use as constraints on instantaneous application rates limit the ability to maintain sufficient soil moisture to avoid negative impacts on crop yield. We demonstrate that this important behavioral response to limited groundwater availability is not captured by existing modeling approaches, which therefore may be unreliable predictors of irrigation demand, agricultural profitability, and resilience to climate change and aquifer depletion.},

  abstract = {Seventeen Italian experiments relating to maize, soyabean and durum wheat were used to analyse the variability of duration of tolerated competition (DTC) and weed-free period (WFP) curves across reasonably homogeneous areas. The data sets were analysed by regression analysis using four models relating yield loss to weed density, time of emergence and removal. These models differ in the way they account for the effect of time of weed removal on potential competitiveness. A sigmoidal relationship between these two variables appears necessary. The model with the best overall performance was then used to test the stability of the parameters that give the shape of the curve in relation to time of emergence and removal. This was done by comparing a full model with shape parameters specific to each experiment and a reduced model with a common set of parameters for all the experiments referring to a specific crop. For all three crops, the residual sum of squares of the reduced model did not increase significantly, indicating that, across tested environments, the yield loss caused by mixed weed infestations can be expressed by a single set of parameters relating weed competitivity to time of emergence and removal. For a given area, it should therefore be possible to predict yield loss on the basis of a quite limited set of experiments, thus greatly simplifying the development and use of decision support systems (DSS).},

Future climate projections are based on IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as simulated by ECHAM4 global climate model downscaled for the Mekong Basin using the PRECIS system. We divided the basin into 14 agro-climatic zones and selected a sub-catchment within each zone for the model and assessed the impact for the period of 2010\textendash{}2030 and 2030\textendash{}2050. In general, the results suggest that yield of rainfed rice may increase significantly in the upper part of the basin in Laos and Thailand and may decrease in the lower part of the basin in Cambodia and Vietnam. The increase is higher during 2030\textendash{}2050 compared to the period of 2010\textendash{}2030 for A2 scenario. For B2 scenario, yield increase is higher during 2010\textendash{}2030. The impact is mainly due to the change in rainfall and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. We have tested widely used adaptation options such as changing planting date, supplementary irrigation, and reduction in fertility stress and found that negative impact on yield can be offset and net increase in yield can be achieved.},

  abstract = {In arid and semi-arid areas, total evaporation is a major component of the hydrological cycle and seasonal water shortages and drought are common. In these areas, the role of land use and land use change is particularly important and it is imperative that land and water resources are well managed. To aid efficient water management, it is useful to demonstrate how changing land use affects water resources. A convenient framework to consider this is through the use of the `blue-water' and `green-water' classification of Falkenmark, where green-water represents water use by land and blue-water represents runoff.

In this study the hydrological response of nine land-use scenarios were simulated for the upper reaches of the Mutale River, an important tributary of the Luvuvhu River in S. Africa. The ACRU and HYLUC land use sensitive hydrological models, were used to investigate the change in blue and green water under the various land-use scenarios.

The GIS software ArcGIS(8.3) was used to analyse available spatial data to generate inputs required by the hydrological models. The scenarios investigated included the current land use in the catchment, an increase or decrease in forest cover, and an increase or decrease in the area irrigated. Both models predict that increasing either forestry or irrigation significantly reduces the proportion of blue water in the catchment.

The predictions from the models were combined with maps of catchment land use, to illustrate the changes in distribution of green and blue water in a user-friendly manner. The use of GIS in this way is designed to enable policy-makers and managers to quickly assimilate the water resource implication of the land use change.},

  abstract = {Descriptive and explanatory modelling of biomass production and yield of horticultural crops is reviewed with special reference to the simulation of leaf area, light interception, dry matter (DM) production, DM partitioning and DM content. Most models for prediction of harvest date (timing of production) are descriptive. For DM production many descriptive and explanatory models have been developed. Most explanatory models are photosynthesis-based models. Important components of photosynthesis-based models are leaf area development, light interception, photosynthesis and respiration. Leaf area is predominantly simulated as a function of plant developmental stage or of simulated leaf dry weight. Crop photosynthesis can be calculated as a function of intercepted radiation or more accurately by considering radiation absorption of different leaf layers in combination with a submodel for leaf photosynthesis. In most crop growth models respiration is subdivided into two components: growth and maintenance. There is reasonable consensus concerning the simulation of growth respiration, but the simulation of maintenance respiration is still an area of great uncertainty, which is especially important for large crops grown under winter conditions at relatively high greenhouse temperatures. DM partitioning can be simulated by descriptive allometry, functional equilibrium or sink regulation. The most suitable approach depends on the type of crop studied and the aim of the model. As opposed to most agricultural crops, the DM content of the harvestable product is of great importance to the yield of most horticultural crops. More attention should be paid to the simulation of DM content. It is concluded that the strong features of explanatory crop growth models are the simulation of light interception and gross photosynthesis, while the weak features are the simulation of leaf area development, maintenance respiration, organ abortion, DM content and product quality.},

Generally, the RMSEs in simulating soil water content in calibration and validation were 0.01\textendash{}0.039 and 0.012\textendash{}0.037 m3 m-3, respectively, that overall corresponds to 3\textendash{}14 \% error. For the in-season biomass development, the RMSEs in calibration varied between 2.16 and 2.73 Mg ha-1, while they varied between 1.97 and 5.19 Mg ha-1 in validation for the four irrigation managements. The model showed poor performance for simulating biomass late in the season under deficit irrigation managements. The RMSEs of final grain yield simulation were 0.71 and 1.77 Mg ha-1 that corresponded to 7 and 18 \% error in calibration and validation, respectively. Likewise, the RMSEs for simulating the final biomass in calibration and validation were 1.29 and 2.21 Mg ha-1 that equals to 6 and 10 \% error, respectively. Results demonstrated that AquaCrop is a useful decision-making tool for investigating deficit irrigations and maize growth in the region. However, in agreement with the findings in earlier studies on AquaCrop, the model showed insufficient accuracy in simulating final grain yield and biomass under moderate to severe water stresses. It is suggested that AquaCrop would benefit of including some calibrating parameters about the root distribution pattern in the soil because it is a water-driven model and highly depends on the accurately simulated water uptake from the soil profile.},

The IWRAM software integrates a crop model with hydrological and economic models. Presented here is the integrated crop model, called CATCHCROP, which is capable of simulating yield response to water deficit and fertility depletion. External and internal constraints have largely influenced the model construction. Paucity of observed data and its reliability required the use of conceptual and recognized algorithms. Linkages with the economic and hydrological models led to the choice of a 10-days time step. The stand-alone version of the model has been tested against available data sets coming from two small catchments. First results are fairly satisfactory but it is acknowledged that this kind of integrated model should not be used at the farm plot level to assess cropping practices.},

  abstract = {Following up the rather sobering results of the biofuels boom in Tanzania, we analyze the preconditions that would make large-scale oil production from the feedstock Jatropha curcas viable. We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed.},

In this study, the AquaCrop model with a salinity module to simulate the grain yield and water productivity of four wheat varieties, including three salt- tolerant (i.e. KRL-19, KRL-1-4, KRL-210) and one salt non-tolerant variety (i.e. HD-2894) grown under different salinity levels was evaluated. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the Water Technology Centre (WTC), Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, during rabi 2009-10 and 2010-11. The model was calibrated using experiment data of rabi 2009-10 and validated with data of rabi 2010-11. Saline water of 4, 8 and 12 dS m(-1) and groundwater (i.e. 1.5 dS m(-1) during rabi 2009-10 and 1.7 dS m(-1) during rabi 2010-11) were used for irrigation. The validated model prediction error statistics, i.e. model efficiency (ME), index of agreement (d) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for grain yield, were 0.85, 0.96, 0.94 and for biomass 0.7, 0.95, 0.95, respectively, for all varieties and salinity levels. It was observed that the AquaCrop model was better at predicting the grain yield compared to biomass and water productivity for all varieties and salinity levels.

  abstract = {This work investigated the performance of AquaCrop and CropSyst in simulating barley growth under three water treatments (full irrigation, 50\% irrigation and rainfed) and two nitrogen levels (high and low) with a particular attention to the influence of calibration year on the modelling results. Three years (2006\textendash{}2008) of data from the experimental work carried out in Southern Italy were used. The models were calibrated for each of three years and then validated for two other years. The overall results pointed out that both models could be calibrated with data of one of any the three years and validated with all other data. Nevertheless, errors of estimate slightly changed in respect to the year of calibration and were sensitive, from one year to another, to weather conditions and different water and nitrogen regimes. The results indicated AquaCrop superior than CropSyst when the calibration was done on the basis of 2006 and 2008 data, whereas the models performed in a similar way when the calibration was done for 2007. In the case of final biomass, the relative RMSE was lower for AquaCrop (from 0.09 to 0.15) than for CropSyst (from 0.15 to 0.17). Similarly, in the case of final yield, the relative RMSE of AquaCrop was lower (from 0.11 to 0.17) than that of CropSyst (from 0.16 to 0.23). AquaCrop overestimated final biomass by 0.18 and 0.27 t ha-1 for 2006 and 2008 calibration year, respectively, and underestimated biomass by 1.02 t ha-1 when calibration was done on 2007 data. CropSyst underestimated biomass independently on the calibration year, from 0.83 to 1.26 t ha-1.},

  abstract = {Water shortage in agricultural systems has led to low crop water productivity in various farming systems. For smallholder rainfed systems, dry spell occurrences during seasons and in between seasons has severely undermined food security and general livelihoods as the majority of populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, derive their livelihoods solely from rainfed agriculture. This paper presents part of the on-going research to better understand the hydrology and hence improve rainfed water productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. The study showed that rainwater alone is not sufficient to support maize which is the preferred staple food crop hence the need to employ a combination of improved tillage and rainwater harvesting techniques which help to boost crop yields. The study showed that with as little rainfall as 186\textendash{}403 mm/season yields of up to 4.8 t ha-1 can be achieved through the application of more efficient soil and water retention techniques compared to much less than 1 t ha-1 as presently achieved. It was concluded that water is the limiting factor to productivity and that a combination of rainwater harvesting and conservation agriculture can contribute to improved grain yields by as much as 80\%. There was no significant improvement to treatments with manure and/or cover crop. Water availability indeed plays a significant role in the yields realised. The challenge then is to better understand how, at field scale, the existing water partitioning process can be altered to channel more water into the productive green water processes at the expense of the non-productive white and green water fluxes.},

However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

  abstract = {The performance of a water balance model is also based on the ability
to correctly perform simulations in heterogeneous soils. The objective
of this paper is to test CRITERIA and AquaCrop models in order to
evaluate their suitability in estimating evapotranspiration at the field
scale in two types of soil in the Mediterranean region: non-stony and
stony soil. The first step of the work was to calibrate both models under
the non-stony conditions. The models were calibrated by using observations
on wheat crop (leaf area index or canopy cover, and phenological
stages as a function of degree days) and pedo-climatic measurements.
The second step consisted in the analysing the impact of the
soil type on the models performances by comparing simulated and
measured values. The outputs retained in the analysis were soil water
content (at the daily scale) and crop evapotranspiration (at two time
scales: daily and crop season). The model performances were evaluated
through four statistical tests: normalised difference (D\%) at the
seasonal time scale; and relative root mean square error (RRMSE),
efficiency index (EF), coefficient of determination (r2) at the daily
scale. At the seasonal scale, values of D\% were less than 15\% in stony
and on-stony soils, indicating a good performance attained by both
models. At the daily scale, the RRMSE values (\ensuremath{<}30\%) indicate that the
evapotranspiration simulated by CRITERIA is acceptable in both soil
types. In the stony soil conditions, 3 out 4 statistical tests (RRMSE, EF,
r2) indicate the inadequacy of AquaCrop to simulate correctly daily
evapotranspiration. The higher performance of CRITERIA model to
simulate daily evapotranspiration in stony soils, is due to the soil submodel,
which requires the percentage skeleton as an input, while
AquaCrop model takes into account the presence of skeleton by reducing
the soil volume.},

  abstract = {In the Southern Bolivian Altiplano recent research has suggested to introduce deficit irrigation as a strategy to boost quinoa yields and to stabilize it at 2.0 ton ha-1. In this study we carried out an economic assessment of the implementation of deficit irrigation at farm level using a hydro-economic model for simulating profit for quinoa production. As input of the model we worked with previously developed farms typology (livestock, quinoa and subsistence farms), simulated quinoa production with and without irrigation using AquaCrop model, and calculated yield response functions for four different climate scenarios (wet, normal, dry and very dry years). Results from the hydro-economic model demonstrate that maximum profit is achieved with less applied irrigated water than for maximum yield, and irrigated quinoa earned more profit than rainfed production for all farms types and climate scenarios. As expected, the benefits of irrigation under dry and very dry climate conditions were higher than those under normal and wet years, and benefits among farms types were higher for quinoa farms. In fact, profit of irrigated quinoa might be stabilized at around BOB 6500 ha-1 (about USD 920) compared with the huge differences found for rainfed conditions for all climate scenarios. Interestingly, the economic water productivity, expressed in terms of economic return for amount of applied irrigated water (BOB mm-1), reached the highest values with intermediate and low level of water availability schemes of deficit irrigation for all climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of crop growth are important for evaluating the effects of water deficits on crop yield or productivity. AquaCrop was developed by the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) of the United Nations to simulate yield responses to changes in the supply of water. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the model's ability to simulate winter wheat performance under full and deficit water conditions on China's Loess Plateau and to study the effect of different irrigation scenarios on wheat yield. The model's output was compared to experimental data collected between 2006 and 2011 at the Changwu Agri-ecological Station on the Loess Plateau. The model accurately estimated the soil water content of the root zone as well as the biomass and grain yields of winter wheat. When simulating the soil water during the 2008\textendash{}2009 growing season, the calculated values of r2, RMSE, ME, and the d-index were 0.98, 8.4 mm, 0.98, and 0.99 for no irrigation; 0.95, 14.4 mm, 0.93, and 0.98 for double irrigation; 0.88, 22.9 mm, 0.68, and 0.90 for triple irrigation; and 0.93, 17.5 mm, 0.75, and 0.9 for quadruple irrigation, respectively. For the grain yield, the r2 values for the model's outputs under the single irrigation, double irrigation, triple irrigation, and quadruple irrigation treatments were 0.80, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.77, respectively. Comparing to no irrigation the highest increases in grain yield were observed for scenarios in which irrigation was applied during the over-wintering and turning green stages. Moreover, the simulations indicated that under double irrigation regimes, water can be withheld during over-wintering and either turning green or stem elongation without greatly reducing yields. The minimum amounts of irrigation water required to achieve high WUE in wet, normal and dry years were 225, 150 and 150 mm, respectively.},

  isbn = {978-0-7844-1354-8},
  abstract = {Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in Malawi and accounts for 40\% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 90\% of export revenues. Corn is the major cereal crop grown as a staple food under rainfed conditions, covers more than 92\% of the total agricultural area, and contributes 54\% of caloric intake. Corn production is the principle occupation and major source of income for more than 80\% of the total population in Malawi. Issues of hunger and food insecurity for the entire nation are associated with scarcity and low corn production. This study evaluates the impacts of climate change in mid-century on rainfed corn production in the Lilongwe District of Malawi. First, outputs of 15 GCMs under different emission scenarios are statistically downscaled. Probability assessment of bounded ranges with known distributions is used to account for the uncertainties of GCMs. AquaCrop is employed to assess potential rainfed corn production with and without climate change. Results show that by mid-century corn production in the Lilongwe District can decrease by as much as 14\% due to temperature increase and precipitation decrease by up to 2.20\ensuremath{^\circ}C and 26\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {An investigation was carried out to assess the climate change impacts on rainfed maize yield using AquaCrop and CERES\textendash{}maize crop simulation models, and evaluation of adaptation measures were performed for Sikkim state of India. Data related to crop phenology retrieved from the field experiments were used to calibrate and validate the crop models for three representative sites. Climate projections of six global circulation models (ECHAM5, CCSM, HadCM3, CSIRO-MK3.0, CGCM3.1, and MIROC3.2) for scenarios A2 and B2 were bias-corrected at station scale by power law transformation. Simulation results by the two crop models indicate a significant declination in the yield of NLD-White variety of maize ranging from 4.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.4 to 20.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 7.2 \% for the future time windows under A2 scenario and 2.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.9 to 15.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 5.7 \% under B2 scenario relative to the yield simulated for the baseline period of 1991\textendash{}2000. It is also observed that, for a particular temperature, yield remarkably increases with escalated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. On contrary, increase in temperature reduces the yield at a particular CO2 concentration. The overall decline in the yield under future climate scenarios can be alleviated by early planting, appropriate nutrient management, introducing supplementary irrigation, and shifting to heat-tolerant varieties.},

  abstract = {Following the Integrated Water Resources Management approach, the European Water Framework Directive demands Member States to develop water management plans at the catchment level. Those plans have to integrate the different interests and must be developed with stakeholder participation. To face these requirements, managers need tools to assess the impacts of possible management alternatives on natural and socio-economic systems. These tools should ideally be able to address the complexity and uncertainties of the water system, while serving as a platform for stakeholder participation. The objective of our research was to develop a participatory integrated assessment model, based on the combination of a crop model, an economic model and a participatory Bayesian network, with an application in the middle Guadiana sub-basin, in Spain. The methodology is intended to capture the complexity of water management problems, incorporating the relevant sectors, as well as the relevant scales involved in water management decision making. The integrated model has allowed us testing different management, market and climate change scenarios and assessing the impacts of such scenarios on the natural system (crops), on the socio-economic system (farms) and on the environment (water resources). Finally, this integrated assessment modelling process has allowed stakeholder participation, complying with the main requirements of current European water laws.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.03.009},
  abstract = {Pastoral systems are characterised by a number of features that are absent in arable cropping systems. These features include: (i) pastures are biologically diverse so interactions between plant species must be considered; (ii) economic return requires the inclusion of the animal as an additional trophic level; (iii) interaction between the grazing animal and the pasture is complex, influenced by the environment, plant species and animal behaviour and this creates feedbacks that can result in vicious cycles; (iv) animals spatially transfer substantial amounts of nutrients both randomly and systematically and this creates or exacerbates soil variability; and (v) whole farm management is both more complex and more important to system function in grazed compared to arable systems and it is harder to capture in simulation models. These challenges complicate the process-based modelling of pastoral systems and present significant obstacles to model developers and users.

Here we discuss these challenges, describe the range of solutions used by different models and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions. We have placed particular emphasis on the analysis of a range of possible solutions with the point of view that diversity between and within models is important to provide the flexibility needed for future uses.

We find that for most challenges there is a diversity of solutions incorporated into the models and that there is the potential to capture additional diversity, if needed, from other models. We note an apparent lack of development in the modelling of extreme events such as very high temperatures, systematic animal-mediated nutrient transfers, pests, weeds and gene-environment interactions in pastoral simulation models and suggest that these subject areas should receive more attention.},

  abstract = {Climate change will alter the environmental conditions for crop growth and require adjustments in management practices at the field scale. In this paper, we analyzed the impacts of two different climate change scenarios on optimal field management practices in winterwheat and grain maize production with case studies from Switzerland. Management options included nitrogen fertilization (amount, timing and allocation) as well as irrigation. Optimal solutions that maximize the farmer's utility were sought with the help of a bioeconomic modeling system that integrated the process-based crop growth model CropSyst into an economic decision model. The latter accounted not only for the crop specific average profit margins, but also for production risks, reflecting the utility (expressed as the certainty equivalent) of a risk-averse farmer's management decisions at field scale. In view of the non-linearity and complexity of the problem, we used a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. For grain maize, our results showed that climate change will foster the use of irrigation, not only at sites prone to water limitation already under current climatic conditions, but more in general for climate change scenarios projecting a substantial decrease in summer precipitation. For winterwheat, irrigation was never identified as an optimal management option. For both crops and sites, climate change reduced the optimum nitrogen fertilization amount and decreased for winterwheat the number of fertilization applications. In all cases, the farmer's certainty equivalent decreased between 7\% and 25\% under climate change, implying negative impacts on winterwheat and grain maize production even under the assumption of an adjustment of the optimum management practices.},

  abstract = {Durum wheat is the most important C3 rainfed crop in southern Sardinia, Italy. Climate variability and socio- economic factors are the main sources of uncertainty and concern for farmers in this region that has experienced severe drought conditions and problems of competing water demands during the last decades. Within the framework of a European Union project, CLIMB (Climate Induced Changes in the Mediterranean Region), durum wheat production was simulated under future climate change conditions to evaluate the effects of increased maximum temperature and high rainfall variability on crop yield, and the adaptability of the crop response. The first stage of this work was devoted to properly calibrating the AquaCrop model and testing its predictive performance, prior to applying it under future climate change scenarios. Durum wheat (CV Creso) yield and daily meteorological data collected and recorded in the Agris experimental fields during the period 1995\textendash{}2012 were systematically checked and analyzed before their use for calibration of the AquaCrop model. After calibration the model showed a generally good performance with a significant correlation between observed and simulated yield for durum wheat during the considered period, including the year 1995 that was characterized by a severe drought that led to water stress conditions. A future scenario of climate change was then used as input to the AquaCrop model to predict wheat yield response and to investigate the control of water availability on rainfed crop production for the period 1951\textendash{}2100. The simulated future scenarios show potential improved productivity arising from the increased CO2 concentration. This encouraging result is however tempered by increased uncertainty and fluctuations in rainfall during the fall and early winter periods (September\textendash{}December). The possible tradeoffs between these factors, as well as the expected negative effects of increased maximum temperatures, are being further examined.},

Initial biomass (IB), crop growth rate (CGR), leaf area index (LAI), and biomass at tillering of O. sativa plants were associated with their competitiveness against weeds, whereas relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, and tillering capacity of O. sativa were not. Biomass at tillering affected weed biomass directly, and IB, CGR, and LAI indirectly affected weed biomass through O. sativa biomass. Biomass at tillering was the best predictor of modern cultivar competitiveness against weeds. Nomenclature: Oryza sativa L., rice.},

  abstract = {The BIOMASS methodology was developed with the objective of constructing defensible assessment biospheres for assessing potential radiological impacts of radioactive waste repositories. To this end, a set of Example Reference Biospheres were developed to demonstrate the use of the methodology and to provide an international point of reference.

In this paper, the performance of the Example Reference Biosphere model ERB 2B associated with the natural release scenario, discharge of contaminated groundwater to the surface environment, was evaluated by comparing its long-term projections of radionuclide dynamics and distribution in a soil-plant system to those of a process-based, transient advection-dispersion model (AD). The models were parametrised with data characteristic of a typical rainfed winter wheat crop grown on a sandy loam soil under temperate climate conditions. Three safety-relevant radionuclides, 99Tc, 129I and 237Np with different degree of sorption were selected for the study.

Although the models were driven by the same hydraulic (soil moisture content and water fluxes) and radiological (Kds) input data, their projections were remarkably different. On one hand, both models were able to capture short and long-term variation in activity concentration in the subsoil compartment. On the other hand, the Reference Biosphere model did not project any radionuclide accumulation in the topsoil and crop compartments. This behaviour would underestimate the radiological exposure under natural release scenarios.

The results highlight the potential role deep roots play in soil-to-plant transfer under a natural release scenario where radionuclides are released into the subsoil. When considering the relative activity and root depth profiles within the soil column, much of the radioactivity was taken up into the crop from the subsoil compartment.

Further improvements were suggested to address the limitations of the Reference Biosphere model presented in this paper.},

Using data published in Jacovides et al. (1988) it was demonstrated that the use of MBE and RMSE separately can lead to a wrong decision in selecting the best model from a suite of candidate models. The t-statistic should be used in conjunction with the MBE and RMSE errors to better evaluate a model's performance. Finally, the t-statistic indicator can be viewed as a supplement of the MBE and RMSE errors in aiding modellers to determine whether or not a model's estimates are statistically significant at a particular confidence level.},

  abstract = {Risks of dry and wet sowing methods of rainfed barley were evaluated in northern Ethiopia. The evaluation was based on yield simulation using a validated AquaCrop model. Risks of failure (false start) were assessed by taking biomass threshold levels (\&lt;0.1 t ha-1) from defined early, normal and late sowing by farmer's and depth criterion over long-term (21\textendash{}41 years) climate observation. The study verified that false start increased over the study area in the order from southwest to southeast and northeast. The risk level due to false start by farmer's criterion ranged from 5 to 37\%, 9 to 37\%, and 9 to 19\% for early, normal and late sowing, respectively, whereas the false start risk by depth criterion ranged from 14 to 29\% for early; 14 to 24\% for normal; and 5 to 23\% for late sowing. The long-term simulated average yield across the stations ranged from 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.8 to 1.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 t ha-1 for early, 0.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 to 1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.5 t ha-1 for normal and 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 to 1.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 t ha-1 for late sowing when farmer's criterion was applied whereas the corresponding average yield when depth criteria was applied ranged from 0.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 to 1.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 t ha-1 for early, 0.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.6 to 1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.7 t ha-1 for normal and 0.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 to 1.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.4 t ha-1 for late sowing. The result suggested that risks of false start reduced and barley yield relatively improved when normal/late sowing was applied based on farmer's criterion or when early/normal sowing was applied based on depth criterion. In most of the cases, stations situated southwest of the catchment were characterized by early onset and late cessation (longer length of growing period) whereas stations situated towards the northeast, northwest and southeast are more characterized by normal or late onset and early or normal cessation (shorter growing period). In general, yield reduced from west to east mainly due to the effect of onset and cessation of rain. This study also showed that weed infestation was prevalent when early sowing was applied. Thus to minimize the risk of false start and to reduce cost of weeding, sowing should be scheduled after sufficient moisture is ensured during which especially grass weeds would emerge before sowing so that the emerged weeds could be plowed over.},

  abstract = {Many crop models have been developed for potato, and a few for sweet potato, and yam. More than 30 potato models, two sweet potato models, and three yam models are described in the literature, and each differ in model structure. Some potato models have been applied to studies of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact, but most of these models have never been validated with field measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested with some field data. LPOTCO and AQUACROP are two potato models that have been tested under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. None of the models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data. The most tested and applied potato models include versions of LINTUL and SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, MADHURAM and SPOTCOMS, and two yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato, sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii) tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature, heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam research.},

  abstract = {A multi-criteria model evaluation protocol is presented to check the performance of rainfall-runoff models during model calibration and validation phases based on a high frequency (e.g. hourly, daily) river flow series. The multiple criteria or objectives are based on multiple and non-commensurable measures of information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the river flow series in subflows, split of the series in nearly independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of nearly independent peak and low flows. The protocol accounts for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals, significantly advanced through the use of nearly independent flow values extracted from the flow series. Next to the separate evaluation of the subflow recessions, the quick and slow runoff peak and low values and event volumes, also the performance of the model in predicting extreme high and low flow statistics is validated. To support the time series processing tasks as well as the application of the multi-criteria model evaluation protocol, a Microsoft Excel-based tool (WETSPRO: Water Engineering Time Series PROcessing tool) has been developed. It is based on the assessment of graphical displays, which complement traditional goodness-of-fit statistics.},

There is however a notable absence of suitable information on the nature and magnitude of these impacts. This work seeks to address this knowledge gap by identifying the nature of the impact of farm dams on the hydrology of catchments in the Murray\textendash{}Darling Drainage Division, Australia. The 12 catchments selected for this analysis span zones of the Division with very different climatic and land use conditions. In 11 of the catchments considered there has been an increase in farm dam development over the last two to three decades. The remaining catchment, on the Jamieson River, has undergone no land use changes over the last 50 years and was selected as a control catchment for testing our approach. Statistically significant reductions in the quantity, potential streamflow response (PSR), were found for two catchments, the Yass River and Broadwater Creek. The average annual increase in farm dam capacity in these two catchments was 1.5 and 3.3\% of mean annual flow, respectively. The remaining nine catchments displayed no statistically significant reductions in PSR for the entire period of simulation. Farm dam capacity information was available for five of the nine catchments. These five catchments displayed significantly smaller increases in farm dam capacity (not more than 0.3\% of mean annual flow per year) than the Yass River and Broadwater Creek catchments.},

  abstract = {Soil evaporation is an important component of the water balance in irrigated agriculture. Mulching can be an effective technique to reduce soil evaporation but its efficiency depends on meteorological conditions and the characteristics of the different mulching materials. The objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness of inorganic (plastic) and organic (pine bark, vine pruning residues, geotextile, and wheat straw) mulching materials for soil evaporation control during the energy-limited and falling-rate evaporation stages. Soil evaporation rates (ER) were quantified through consecutive weighings of initially wet soils placed in trays in the laboratory and in microlysimeters in the field. ER depended on meteorological and experimental conditions, stage of evaporation and type of mulching material. In the falling-rate stage, ERs decreased linearly (p \&lt; 0.001) with decreases in GWC, and for long drying periods the ERs were low and similar among treatments, implying that soil mulching will be ineffective for soil evaporation control in low-frequency irrigation systems. In the energy-limited stage, all mulching materials decreased the ERs in relation to the bare soil, but the plastic, vine residues and pine bark materials had lower ERs than the rest of mulching materials. These materials will be therefore recommended for soil evaporation control in high-frequency irrigation systems where the soil surface remains wet most of the time.},

A number of hydrological models exploit Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps retrieved by remote sensing as a measure of the vegetation cover, in order to enhance the evaluation of evapotranspiration and interception losses.

On the other hand, actual evapotranspiration and vegetation development can be derived through crop growth models, such as AquaCrop, developed by FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), which allows the simulation of the canopy development of the main field crops. We used MODIS LAI images to calibrate AquaCrop according to the canopy cover development of winter wheat. With this aim we exploited an empirical relationship between LAI and canopy cover. In detail Aquacrop was calibrated with MODIS LAI maps collected between 2008 and 2011, and validated with reference to MODIS LAI maps of 2013\textendash{}2014 in Rocchetta Sant'Antonio and Sant'Agata, two test sites in the Carapelle watershed, Southern Italy. Results, in terms of evaluation of canopy cover, provided improvements. For example, for Rocchetta Sant'Antonio, the statistical indexes varyfrom r = 0.40, ER = 0.22, RMSE = 17.28 and KGE = 0.31 (using the model without calibration), to r = 0.86, ER = 0.08, RMSE = 6.01 and KGE 0.85 (after calibration).},

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques offer a unique solution for mapping stress and monitoring its time-course. This article reviews the main issues to be addressed for quantifying stress level from remote sensing observations, and to mitigate its impact on crop production by managing cultural practices. The case of nitrogen fertilization is used here as a paradigm. The derivation of canopy state variables such as the leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) is first addressed. It is demonstrated that the inversion of radiative transfer models leads to useful estimates of these variables. However, because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, better accuracy is achieved when using prior information on the distribution of the variables and when multiplying LAI by Cab to get canopy level chlorophyll content. This variable, LAI\texttimes{}Cab is well suited for quantifying canopy level nitrogen content. It is used for nitrogen stress evaluation by comparison with a reference unstressed situation which is, however, not easy to get in practice. The combination of remote sensing observations with crop models provides an elegant solution for stress quantification through assimilation approaches. It fuses several sources of information within our knowledge of the processes involved and accounts for the environmental budget which can be integrated when making decisions about cultural practices. Conclusions are drawn on the issues related to the retrieval of canopy state variables from remote sensing data, to the link between these observables and crop models, and to the assimilation approaches. Avenues for further research are finally discussed along with the required observation system.},

Previously, it had been calibrated and tested for crops in the UK and western Europe. This paper presents the results of a more rigorous validation in which predictions from the model were compared with measurements on crops grown at three locations in New Zealand, during three seasons, under conditions of optimum water and nutrients. The conditions of the experiments were outside the model's development and calibration range.

Simulation of phenological development, Par interceptance, Par-use efficiency and above-ground dry matter production was very good, with root means square deviations (RMSD) of simulations from observations of less than 10\%. Simulation of grain growth and yield was only fair, with RMSDs between 20 and 30\%. Predictions of final shoot number, grain number and mean grain biomass were poor.

The model validation exercise has highlighted areas where further research is needed to provide definitive descriptions of the response of wheat crops to their environments.},

  abstract = {An essential part of hydrological research focuses on hydrological extremes, such as river peak flows and associated floods, because of their large impact on economy, environment, and human life. These extremes can be affected by potential future environmental change, including global climate change and land cover change. In this paper, the relative impact of both climate change and urban expansion on the peak flows and flood extent is investigated for a small-scale suburban catchment in Belgium. A rainfall-runoff model was coupled to a hydrodynamic model in order to simulate the present-day and future river streamflow. The coupled model was calibrated based on a series of measured water depths and, after model validation, fed with different climate change and urban expansion scenarios in order to evaluate the relative impact of both driving factors on the peak flows and flood extent. The three climate change scenarios that were used (dry, wet winter, wet summer) were based on a statistical downscaling of 58 different RCM and GCM scenario runs. The urban expansion scenarios were based on three different urban growth rates (low, medium, high urban expansion) that were set up by means of an extrapolation of the observed trend of urban expansion. The results suggest that possible future climate change is the main source of uncertainty affecting changes in peak flow and flood extent. The urban expansion scenarios show a more consistent trend. The potential damage related to a flood is, however, mainly influenced by land cover changes that occur in the floodplain. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Rainfall data from five meteorological stations during the period from 1947 to 1996 were analysed on an annual and a monthly basis. Daily data exist from 1957 and analyses from 1957 to 1996 were done on a daily basis. Discussions were held with 60 farmers about rainfall and its variation. Ten of these farmers were interviewed with a questionnaire about rainfall. Analysing annual precipitation and rain periods gave no clear trends over the study period. Results from analysing the growing seasons for maize, the main annual crop, and periods during which maize plants are sensitive to drought showed decreasing trends in rainfall amounts for the study period. Results from the interviews indicate that most of the farmers think rainfall has decreased over the last 40 years. Farmers'perceptions of rainfall are related to periods when the main food and annual crop require water and not to the periods scientists often analyse, i.e. annual and rain periods. More research and better advice from agricultural extension workers to farmers are necessary to enable this area to sustain itself in sufficient food production if the decreasing trends during the growing seasons and drought-sensitive periods continue.},

  abstract = {Under low and poorly distributed rainfall higher food production can be achieved by increasing crop water use efficiency (WUE) through optimum soil fertility management and selection of deep-rooting cultivars, appropriate plant density and planting dates. We explored AquaCrop's applicability in selecting adaptive practices for improving maize yield and WUE under rainfed smallholder farming in semi-arid Zimbabwe. AquaCrop was first tested using field measurements without calibration. The model was subsequently applied to estimate the effect of effective rooting depth (ERD), plant density and planting date on maize yield. Simulations were done with daily rainfall data for 25 seasons. During model testing AquaCrop simulated canopy cover development well and simulated biomass accumulation showed good agreement with measured values. The model overestimated soil water, and observed final biomass and grain yield were 96 and 92\% of simulated values, respectively. Model application showed that increasing ERD from 0.40 m at 32,500 plants ha-1 to 0.60 m at 44,400 plants ha-1 increased grain yield from 6.0 to 7.8 t ha-1, biomass water use efficiency by 20.5\%, grain water use efficiency by 23.6\% and transpiration water use efficiency by 26.8\%. At 0.60 and 0.80 m ERD and 44,400 plants ha-1, biomass and grain yield, and WUE, were similar. Drainage below the rootzone was \ensuremath{\geq}40\% of non-productive water losses in normal and wet seasons whilst soil evaporation contributed 47\% in dry seasons at 0.80 m ERD. To improve yield and WUE, we recommend: incorporation of deep-rooting legumes, deeper-rooting cultivars (\ensuremath{\geq}0.60 m effective rooting depth) and practices that improve ERD, a plant density of 44,400 plants ha-1; and practices that reduce soil evaporation e.g. mulching and addition of organic fertilisers to improve soils' available water capacity and enhance response to mineral fertilisers. Further research should include field testing of results from this study with farmers.},

It is unlikely, however, that breeding objectives conserving traditional crop characteristics as found in extensive systems would have been more successful. The authors identify systems caught in the agricultural transition from subsistence to intensified, market-oriented production as the most important target for crop improvement, and provide examples of new breeding objectives for cowpea, sorghum and upland rice. In each of these cases, breeders, with the help of physiologists, have developed innovative plant-type concepts that combine improved yield potential and input responsiveness with specific traditional crop characteristics that remain essential during the agricultural transition. In the case of cowpea, dual-purpose varieties were developed that produce a good grain yield due to an erect plant habit, then produce new leaves enabling a second harvest of green foliage. For upland rice systems that are limited by labour (mainly needed to control weeds that abound due to shortened fallow periods), a weed competitive plant type was developed from Oryza sativa \texttimes{} Oryza glaberrima crosses. Lastly, sorghum breeders who had previously deselected photoperiod sensitivity are now re-inserting sensitivity into plants having ``modern'' architecture, in order to allow for flexible sowing dates while maintaining an agro-ecologically optimal time of flowering near the end of the wet season. The ecophysiological basis of these plant types, their place in current and future cropping systems, as well as the problem of under-funding for their realisation, are discussed.},

  issn = {0043-1745},
  abstract = {The influence of weeds on crop yield is not only dependent on weed-related factors such as density and time of emergence, but also on environmental and management factors that affect both the weed and crop through time. This study was undertaken to develop the first physiologically based dry bean model that would account for the influence of weed competition. The specific objective was to develop a model that would account for the influence of weed competition on crop yield, and to use this model to test the hypothesis that crop yield losses resulted from competition for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). To this end, a model that simulated the growth and development of dry bean was developed. The model performed daily calculations and simulated the phenology, leaf area expansion, dry matter production and distribution, and grain yield of dry bean based on weather and management information, but assumed adequate water and nutrients. The model was calibrated without weed competition at two locations and yr, and for these situations, adequately described the growth and development of the crop. Simulations were then run for five common ragweed densities and two times of emergence. Common ragweed leaf area was read into the model from input files and used to simulate weed shading. Shading of the dry bean canopy by common ragweed accounted for about 50 to 70\% of the yield losses observed in field studies when weeds emerged with the crop. Weed shading did not account for the yield reduction measured from weeds that emerged at the second trifoliate stage of crop growth. The agreement between model predictions and field studies was consistent with the hypothesis that competition for PAR was a principal factor in weed-crop interaction. The ability to account for differences in weed densities, management, and environmental conditions suggested that modeling was a useful tool for evaluating the interaction among weeds and crops.},

  abstract = {Crop models assist in generating crop productivity trends under future climate and different irrigation water supply scenarios. In this study, the AquaCrop model with a salinity module to simulate the grain yield and water productivity of four wheat varieties, including three salt- tolerant (i.e. KRL-19, KRL-1-4, KRL-210) and one salt non-tolerant variety (i.e. HD-2894) grown under different salinity levels was evaluated. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the Water Technology Centre (WTC), Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, during rabi 2009-10 and 2010-11. The model was calibrated using experiment data of rabi 2009-10 and validated with data of rabi 2010-11. Saline water of 4, 8 and 12 dS m(-1) and groundwater (i.e. 1.5 dS m(-1) during rabi 2009-10 and 1.7 dS m(-1) during rabi 2010-11) were used for irrigation. The validated model prediction error statistics, i.e. model efficiency (ME), index of agreement (d) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for grain yield, were 0.85, 0.96, 0.94 and for biomass 0.7, 0.95, 0.95, respectively, for all varieties and salinity levels. It was observed that the AquaCrop model was better at predicting the grain yield compared to biomass and water productivity for all varieties and salinity levels.

RESUME Les modeles de cultures aident a generer les tendances de la productivite des cultures sous contrainte de changement climatique et differents scenarios d'approvisionnement en eau d'irrigation. Dans cette etude, le modele AquaCrop avec son module de salinite est utilise pour simuler le rendement en grains et de la productivite de l'eau de quatre varietes de ble, a savoir trois tolerantes au sel (i.e. KRL-19, KRL-1-4, KRL-210) et une non tolerante au sel (i.e. HD-2894), qui ont ete cultivees et evaluees sous differents niveaux de salinite. L'experience a ete menee a la ferme de recherche du Centre Water Technology (WTC) de l'Institut indien de recherche agricole (IARI), New Delhi, pendant le rabi 2009-10 et 2010-11. Le modele a ete calibre a partir de donnees experimentales de rabi 2009-10 et valide avec les donnees de rabi 2010-11. De l'eau salee de 4, 8 et 12 du DSM-1 et de l'eau de la nappe (1.5 DSM-1 en 2009-10 et 1.7 DSM-1 en 2010-11) ont ete utilisees pour l'irrigation. Les erreurs statiques de prediction du modele valides, soit l'efficacite du modele (ME), l'indice de l'accord (d) et le coefficient de determination (R-2) pour le rendement en grain etaient de 0.85, 0.96, 0.94, et, pour la biomasse de 0.7, 0.95, 0.95, respectivement, pour toutes les varietes et les niveaux de salinite. Il a ete observe que le modele AquaCrop predisait mieux le rendement en grains que la biomasse et la productivite de l'eau pour toutes les varietes et les niveaux de salinite.

  abstract = {Water shortage in China, particularly in the north and northwest of China, is very serious. The region accounts for half of the total area of China, but has less than 20\% of total national available water resources. While the water shortage in this region is severe, irrigation water use efficiency is only about 40\%, with a typical agricultural water use efficiency of about 0.46 kg m-3. Excessive irrigation in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia has had a significant influence on downstream water users along the Yellow River. It is widely believed that an increase in the agricultural water use efficiency is the key to mitigating water shortage and reducing environmental problems. This paper reviews water-saving agricultural systems and approaches to improve agricultural water use efficiency in the arid and semiarid areas of China. The paper will cover biological mechanisms of water-saving agriculture and water-saving irrigation technologies, including low pressure irrigation, furrow irrigation, plastic mulches, drip irrigation under plastic, rainfall harvesting and terracing. In addition, the paper addresses the compensatory effect of limited irrigation and fertilizer supplementation on water use efficiency and highlights the need to breed new varieties for high water use efficiency. Considerable potential for further improvement in agricultural water use efficiency in the region depends on effective conservation of moisture and efficient use of the limited water.},

  abstract = {The proposed study draws a novel framework to assess the sustainability of winter wheat under climate change
conditions and irrigation as an adaptionmeasure to reduce yield variability. The methodology combines outputs
from a general circulation model (GCM), the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) crop growth model
(AquaCrop), a life cycle assessment (LCA) model and economic modelling. Long-term observed climate data
(1970\textendash{}1991) collected in Cambridge (Cambridgeshire, UK) were used to downscale the projected climate data
from the GCM for 2050. The structural characteristics of the case study are representative of a typical farm in
this UK region. A six-year average wheat price (2007\textendash{}2012) was considered and the irrigation costs for the economicmodelwere
calculated assuming themarket prices in 2014. Sensitivity analysis assessed in the longer term
included the expected variations due to the increase in world wheat prices and the energy costs.
The direct impacts of climate change on winter wheat grown in the East of England, would be a reduction in the
rainfed yield (between -5.4\% and -32.9\%), stronger under the low emission scenario (B1). The projected
economic losses from rainfed winter wheat production are expected to range between -43.6\% and -100.0\%.
Irrigation could in the future be an adaptation measure for yield increase (10.5\% to 64.3\%), lower under B1 and
to improve the financial appraisal of irrigation investment which would raise between 41 and 429 \textsterling{} ha-1.
However, negative externalities are exacerbating pressures on air and water resources; an increase in irrigation
water requirements between 25.0\% and 39.1\% increases global warming potential between 20.4\% and 28.3\%.
Environmental indicators under scenario B1 performed better than the high emission scenario (A1). Finally,
under future climate scenarios, the results confirmed that irrigated winter wheat grown on lighter soils using
hose reel sprinkler systems fitted with a boom, is more sustainable than that grown on heavier soils using
hose reel sprinkler systems fitted with a raingun.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2008.03.001},
  abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (2000) offers a new challenge for farmers and water policy makers. It requires the establishment of quantitative environmental diagnosis of water quality. This can be done using crop models properly tested in the short and long-terms and taking into account current farming practices. The aim of this paper is to check the robustness of a crop model (STICS) for predicting the nitrogen uptake and nitrate leaching in various fields during 8 successive years. The model was evaluated on the soil\textendash{}crop database of a small catchment in northern France. It includes data of crop production and N uptake, water and mineral nitrogen contents in soil measured three times a year at 36 sampling sites representative of crops (wheat, sugar beet, pea, barley, oilseed rape) and soil parent materials (loam, loamy clay and rocks, sandy loam and limestone, sand). A few crop parameters of STICS were recalibrated on independent databases in order to improve the predictions obtained with the standard parameterization. STICS was then evaluated either by resetting simulations each year (RS) or during continuous simulations (CS) over the 8 years. A reasonable agreement was obtained between observed and simulated values, except for soil N mineral content at harvest and N content in crop residues. The model efficiencies using CS mode were 0.53, 0.94 and 0.38 for N uptake, soil water and mineral N in late autumn, respectively. The mean calculated drainage was 192 mm y-1 and N leaching was estimated at 20 kg N ha-1 y-1, respectively. Averaging the outputs according to soil and crop type improved the quality of fit. The outputs of CS simulations were close to those obtained with RS. The mean nitrate concentration in water drainage was estimated as 46 and 45 mg NO3 l-1 with RS and CS, respectively. Continuous simulations did not induce a substantial drift in mineral N in late autumn and can be trusted for predicting nitrate leaching. However, the leaching predictions were more sensitive to spatially variable parameters such as maximal rooting depth and potential mineralisation rate for CS than for RS. This emphasizes the difficulty in extrapolating the model over the long-term for large spatial areas. Another important uncertainty concerns fertiliser use efficiency, which had a small effect on leaching but a marked influence on gaseous N losses. Further assessments of the model will concern the whole N balance prediction over the long-term.},

  abstract = {A quantitative model of the balance between inputs and outputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in African land use systems (NUTBAL) was recently developed at two scales: supra-national (38 sub-Saharan African countries) and regional (Kisii District, Kenya). Calculating inputs (mineral fertilizer, organic manure, wet and dry deposition, biological nitrogen fixation, sedimentation) and outputs (removal of above-ground crop parts, leaching, denitrification, water erosion) led to the conclusion that there are considerable net fertility losses in each growing period. In this paper, NUTBAL is elaborated into a decision-support model (NUTMON) to monitor the effects of changing land use, and suggest interventions that improve the nutrient balance. As input and output determinants cannot all be quantified equally well, the model recognizes primary data, estimates, and assumptions. The NUTMON determinants are mostly scale-neutral and can therefore be used to monitor nutrient balances at farm, regional, national and supra-national level. This is essential since the hierarchical levels interact. A number of recent interventions at the regional level (Kisii District, Kenya) are elaborated, including national fertilizer and produce price policies, fertilizer supply in small packages, zero-grazing, agroforestry, soil conservation measures, and increasing fertilizer use efficiency. It is shown that a major nutrient conservation effort in Kisii reduces nutrient depletion by approximately 50\%, but does not entirely redress the N and K balance. To achieve the latter without reducing crop production, 75\% of the district would have to be converted to a rotation system of maize and green manure cover crops, whereas 25\% can remain under tea. NUTMON has the potential to become a dynamic tool for land use policies, geared towards a balanced nutrient status in African land use systems. It can assist decision makers in determining the effects of current and alternative land use scenarios, taking account of both the productivity as well as the long-term sustainability of agro-ecosystems.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0078828},
  abstract = {Increasing crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in dryland farming requires a quantitative understanding of relationships between crop yield and the water balance over many years. Here, we report on a long-term dryland monitoring site at the Loess Plateau, Shanxi, China, where winter wheat was grown for 30 consecutive years and soil water content (0\textendash{}200 cm) was measured every 10 days. The monitoring data were used to calibrate the AquaCrop model and then to analyse the components of the water balance. There was a strong positive relationship between total available water and mean cereal yield. However, only one-third of the available water was actually used by the winter wheat for crop transpiration. The remaining two-thirds were lost by soil evaporation, of which 40 and 60\% was lost during the growing and fallow seasons, respectively. Wheat yields ranged from 0.6 to 3.9 ton/ha and WUE from 0.3 to 0.9 kg/m3. Results of model experiments suggest that minimizing soil evaporation via straw mulch or plastic film covers could potentially double wheat yields and WUE. We conclude that the relatively low wheat yields and low WUE were mainly related to (i) limited rainfall, (ii) low soil water storage during fallow season due to large soil evaporation, and (iii) poor synchronisation of the wheat growing season to the rain season. The model experiments suggest significant potential for increased yields and WUE.},

  abstract = {A simulation model was built as a decision aid for management of five weed species in direct seeded irrigated onion (Allium cepa L.). The model uses the state variable approach and simulations are driven by temperature and sunlight as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). It predicts yield reduction caused by competition for PAR according to the ratio of crop leaf area index (LAI) to weed LAI and respective light extinction coefficients (k). Input variables are plant density by species and average number of leaves by species. Number of leaves per plant is used by the model to provide an estimate of initial leaf area per plant. The model calculates initial species LAIs by multiplying species density times average leaf area per plant. The model accurately describes competitive interactions, taking into account respective plant densities, time of emergence, and time of weed removal. It permits economic evaluation of management factors such as handweeding, chemical weed control, herbicide phytotoxicity due to early application, and control of weed flushes during the season. The model is also used to evaluate mechanisms of plant competition for sunlight. In a sensitivity analysis, onion yield loss was more sensitive to weed PAR interception than to PAR use efficiency, the latter a species-dependent constant in the model.},

  abstract = {Crop growth simulation models have become important tools to assess and develop deficit irrigation
strategies especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study,wetested the ability of the FAO developed
AquaCrop model (V 4.0) to simulate canopy cover (CC), actual evapotranspiration (ETcact), total soil water
content (TWC) and grain yield (GY) for winter wheat under flood irrigation in the semi-arid region of
Tensift Al Haouz, Marrakech (center of Morocco). The simulation was performed at a daily time step, using
thermal units, i.e., growing degree days (GDDs) during two successive growing seasons: 2002/2003 and
2003/2004. Firstly, the calibration of the model was performed on three fields during 2002/2003 cropping
season. Various parameters affecting CC, ETcact,TWCandGYhave been calibrated based on the comparison
between measurements and the results of simulations. Afterward, the validation was done on six fields
during the 2003/2004 cropping season. The results showed that the model simulates reasonably well CC,
ETcact, TWC and GY over two growing seasons. The average values of the Mean Bias Error (MBE) between
observed and measured CC, ETcact,TWCandGYwere-4.6\%,-0.23 mm/day, 17.56mmand 0.05 t/ha for the
calibration fields, and 7.89\%, -0.01 mm/day, 0.5mm and 0.06 t/ha for the validation fields, respectively.
Additional statistical parameters like the root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash\textendash{}Sutcliffe efficiency
(NSE) showed also that the model gives acceptable estimates of CC, ETcact, TWC and GY.
After accurate calibration and validation of the AquaCrop model, it was used for irrigation scheduling
based on the threshold of the root zone water depletion (Dr,threshold) over two fields with contrasted
sowing dates. The various simulations (irrigation scenarios) showed that early sowing is more adequate
than late sowing in saving water and obtaining adequate grain yield. It has been also shown that the
value 0.6 of Dr, threshold can be used as an appropriate threshold of water depletion to improve the wheat
irrigation management. Consequently, the AquaCrop model can be considered as a potentially useful tool
for planning irrigation schedules on an operational basis in the arid and semi-arid regions},

  abstract = {Crop models are used to predict yield and resource requirements as well as to evaluate different climate or management scenarios at a specific site. However, problems involving land use or global climate change encompass larger, more diverse, spatial scales and would benefit from simulating over broader areas using high-resolution, spatially-distributed data. A geospatial interface was developed to combine the explanatory potato crop model SPUDSIM with the geographic information system (GIS) software ArcGIS using the scripting language Python. Multiple geospatial input data layers were incorporated, including weather, soil, management, and land use. Modeling units (MUs) were defined as homogeneous field-scale areas created by the intersection of the input layers. Crop production was simulated for each unique combination of climate, soil, and management for MUs classified as cropland. The outputs (crop yield, water use, and nitrogen uptake) were mapped to show the spatial distribution within each county and aggregated to the county-level over the region of interest. An example was provided for potato production in Maine and illustrates how potential crop yield varies spatially over the state. The geospatial crop model showed evidence of both spatial and temporal variability of crop yield at the county level. The interface was designed to be flexible and easy to apply to applications such as evaluating crop production capacity and response under different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Defining crop response to water is a crucial part of decision-making for agricultural water management. This study is proposing an efficient and a low-cost approach to validate FAO's AquaCrop model using remote sensing (RS) estimates instead of crop ground measurements. A radiance use efficiency (RUE) based RS model for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) is proposed with Landsat images and regional crop information. The RS estimates are used to validate AquaCrop's built-in crops and calibrate it under salinity stress. As a result, RS estimates of canopy cover (CC) and AGB were produced from an existing CC model and the proposed AGB model, respectively. These estimates became good replacements of the ground measurements for validation and calibration. Built-in maize of AquaCrop showed good agreement between simulations and RS estimates under non-stress conditions whereas built-in barley underestimated AGB compared to the RS estimates. By comparing the RS estimates in salinity-affected farms to AquaCrop simulations without considering salinity stress, AGB reduction due to salinity stress and corresponding CC reduction were quantified for calibration of AquaCrop under salinity stress. The results of calibration predicted initial soil salinity of saline-stressed farms and the values are within the possible ranges. The proposed methodology shows that the readily available Landsat images and regional crop information could extend the validation of built-in crops of AquaCrop to regions without ground measurements.},

One shows that the same simple equation governs the dry matter increase of many U.K. crops during May to September when there are ample supplies of water and nutrients. Another defines the decline in the critical concentration of N in plant material with crop development. Others cover root development in soil and uptake of nitrate by these roots. These theories have been combined to form a dynamic model for estimating day-to-day responses to N fertilizer of crops grown in the field. Simulation studies with the model indicate that failure to take account of variations in subsoil nitrate and rooting depth is a major cause of uncertainty in forecasting fertilizer requirements in the U.K.},

  abstract = {Straw mulching is an effective measure to conserve soil moisture. However, the existence of straw on the soil surface also affects soil temperature, which in turn influences crop growth, especially of winter crops. Five-year field experiments (2000\textendash{}2005) investigated the effects of straw mulching and straw mass on soil temperature, soil evaporation, crop growth and development, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at Luancheng Station on the North China Plain. Soil is a moderately well-drained loamy soil with a deep profile at the station. Two quantities of mulch were used: 3000 kg ha-1 [less mulching (LM)] and 6000 kg ha-1 [more mulching (MM)], representing half and all of the straw from the previous crop (maize). In the control (CK), the full quantity of mulch was ploughed into the top 20 cm of soil. The results showed that the existence of straw on the soil surface reduced the maximum, but increased the minimum diurnal soil temperature. When soil temperature was decreasing (from November to early February the next year), soil temperature (0\textendash{}10 cm) under straw mulching was on average 0.3\ensuremath{^\circ}C higher for LM and 0.58\ensuremath{^\circ}C higher for MM than that without mulching (CK). During the period when soil temperature increased (from February to early April, the recovery and jointing stages of winter wheat), average daily soil temperature of 0\textendash{}10 cm was 0.42\ensuremath{^\circ}C lower for LM and 0.65\ensuremath{^\circ}C lower for MM than that of CK. With the increase in leaf area index, the effect of mulching on soil temperature gradually disappeared. The lower soil temperature under mulch in spring delayed the development of winter wheat up to 7 days, which on average reduced the final grain yield by 5\% for LM and 7\% for MM compared with CK over the five seasons. Mulch reduced soil evaporation by 21\% under LM and 40\% under MM compared with CK, based on daily measuring of microlysimeters. However, because yield was reduced, the overall WUE was not improved by mulch.},

  abstract = {Water use efficiency ( w ) is a crop parameter of outstanding importance in crop simulation models, derived here as the slope of the relationship linking crop carbon gain to cumulative transpiration. This study aims at: (i) evaluating w of field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea, at three levels of aggregation\textemdash{}day-time net assimilation (A), daily net carbon gain, as difference between A and night-time dark respiration (R), and biomass; (ii) assessing the robustness of w parameter in terms of ability to discriminate between C3 and C4 species, pre- and post-anthesis, impact of nitrogen status; (iii) investigating the opportunity to normalize w by climate, using FAO-Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (Eref) or atmospheric saturation vapour pressure deficit (D); (iv) comparing w with the corresponding radiation use efficiency (\ensuremath{\varepsilon}) results presented in the companion paper. Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999 in southern Italy. All crops were well watered. Sunflower and sorghum had two nitrogen application treatments: wheat had only one and chickpea had no added nitrogen. Closed-system canopy chambers, automated for continuous measurements, were used to monitor gas-exchanges at the canopy scale, in terms of both carbon exchange rate (CER) and evapotranspiration E, and the cuvette method to monitor gas-exchange at the leaf scale. w , expressed in terms of A, A - R, or above-ground biomass, was linear over the entire cycle of sorghum and wheat, and up to anthesis in sunflower and chickpea, independent of temperature, vapour pressure deficit and radiation regimes. In sunflower, deviation from linearity was observed after anthesis due to higher carbon cost in yielding oil seeds. No conclusions could be drawn for post-anthesis chickpea due to the destruction of the crop by a thunderstorm. The overall response patterns were common to w and \ensuremath{\varepsilon}. Nevertheless, w proved to be more robust than \ensuremath{\varepsilon} due to its high capacity to discriminate between species groups (C3 from C4) and its effectiveness in normalizing the values for climate, provided it is implemented through Eref rather than D. All the above confers larger extrapolative ability to w -based crop models.},

  doi = {10.5897/AJAR2014.8703},
  abstract = {This experiment was conducted during February to June 2012 in Demonstration farm of Arba Minch University located in the central rift valley of Ethiopia. The aim was to investigate the effects of different levels of deficit irrigation imposed at different growth stages of maize (BH-140) crop on its development, grain yield and water use efficiency. AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated using field experimentation data. The crop water requirement of maize for full irrigation application was calculated using CropWat 8.0. The water application levels considered were 100\% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), 75\%ETc, 50\%ETc and 25\%ETc. based on these irrigation levels and four growth stages of maize crop, ten treatments were arranged. These treatments were replicated three times. Data collected during the experiment were: crop biomass, soil moisture content, irrigation depths and final yield. The result showed that the highest yield was found in treatment six, T6 (8842 Kg/ha) which was subjected to water deficit during mid- and maturity-stages; whereas minimum yield of about 5264 kg/ha was obtained under T8 which was irrigated imposed to deficit during the whole growing season except during the initial stage. The highest (2.11 kg/m3) and lowest (0.93 kg/m3) water use efficiency was recorded under T8 and T4. Generally, water deficit of 50\%ETc during third and fourth growth stages had no significant effect on the grain yield of maize and it is worthwhile to save irrigation water during these growth stages. The model performed well in simulating the growth of aboveground biomass, grain yield, and canopy cover (CC) for most of the treatments but it was less satisfactory in simulating the growth performance of treatments under prolonged water-deficit. The fact that the AquaCrop model is easy to use, requires less input data, and its sufficient degree of simulation accuracy make it a valuable tool for estimating crop productivity under deficit irrigation, and on-farm water management for improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.landusepol.2009.12.010},
  abstract = {It is well known that urban expansion has a severe impact on the surface water balance by transforming vegetated covers into sealed surfaces. This transformation causes changing fluxes of evapotranspiration, surface runoff and groundwater recharge. In order to estimate the impact of land cover changes on the surface hydrology, hydrological models are often coupled with different types of land cover change models. It is, however, not clear to what extent spatially-explicit urban expansion scenarios provide an added value in comparison with non-spatial urban expansion models at different scale levels. The objective of this paper is to acquire a better insight in the importance of scale effects involved in the coupling of urban expansion scenarios and hydrological models. The relative importance of using different projections of both (i) quantity and (ii) spatial patterns of urban expansion was analysed at four different scale levels. The highly urbanised Flanders\textendash{}Brussels region was taken as an example application. Twelve different urban expansion scenarios for 2025 and 2050 were developed and subsequently used as an input in a spatially-distributed water balance model. The results obtained suggest that at the level of the Flanders\textendash{}Brussels region, an accurate estimation of the quantity of urban expansion should get priority over an accurate projection of the spatial patterns. However, the importance of using accurate projections of the spatial pattern of urban expansion increases systematically at local scale levels. A uniform strategy for coupling urban expansion models and hydrological models thus seems inappropriate. These findings are highly relevant for water management and spatial planning policymakers that typically operate at different administrative levels.},

  abstract = {This study assesses potential impacts of climate change on maize and wheat yields in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia. We considered effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and changes in rainfall during the main (Kiremt) and the short (Belg) rainfall cropping seasons during the two future periods (2020\textendash{}2049 and 2066\textendash{}2095). The MarkSimGCM daily weather generator was used to generate projected rainfall and temperature data using the outputs from ECHAM5 general circulation model and ensemble mean of six models under A2 (high) and B1 (low) emission scenarios. Crop yield simulations were made with the FAO's AquaCrop model. The projected rainfall during Kiremt increases by 12\textendash{}69 \% while rainfall during Belg decreases by 20\textendash{}68 \%. The combined effect of elevated CO2 and projected climate factors increases maize yield by up to 59 \% in sub-humid/humid areas of the CRV, but could result in a decrease of up to 46 \% in the semiarid areas under ECHAM5 model. However, the maize yield increases in all parts of the CRV under the ensemble mean of models. Wheat yield shows no significant response to the projected rainfall changes, but increases by up to 40 \% due to elevated CO2. Our results generally suggest that climate change will increase crop yields in the sub-humid/humid regions of the CRV. However, in the semi-arid parts the overall projected climate change will affect crop yields negatively.},

  abstract = {Variability in water cycles driven by climate change is considered likely to impact rice production in the near future. Rice is the main staple food for the population in the lower Mekong Basin and the demand for food is expected to grow due to increase in population. This paper examines the impact of climate change on rice production in the lower Mekong Basin, evaluates some widely used adaptation options, and analyses their implications for overall food security by 2050. Climate change data used in the study are the future climate projection for two IPCC SRES scenarios, A2 and B2, based on ECHAM4 General Circulation Model downscaled to the Mekong region using the PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) system. In general, the results suggest that yield of rainfed rice may increase significantly in the upper part of the basin in Laos and Thailand and may decrease in the lower part of the basin in Cambodia and Vietnam. Irrigated rice may not be affected by climate change if increased irrigation requirements are met. Negative impact on the yield of rainfed rice can be offset and net increase in yield can be achieved by applying widely used adaptation options such as changing planting date, supplementary irrigation and increased fertilizer input. Analysis of the projected production, considering population growth by 2050, suggests that food security of the basin is unlikely to be threatened by the increased population and climate change, excluding extreme events such as sea level rise and cyclones.},

The soils included chernozem, sandy chernozem and fluvisol with a 2.0 m profile depth. Daily measurements of the soil water content were taken using TDR probes (one per 0.3 m of depth) in six replicates for each soil type. The analysis was carried out for winter wheat and spring barley grown on the site during seasons 2000 and 2001 and included a detailed comparison of the simulated and measured soil water contents as well as an analysis of seasonal soil water balances, root front velocities and an evaluation of the modeled crop yields. CERES and SWAP, in contrast to WOFOST, simulated the grain yield of barley and wheat well. All three models simulated soil water content in the profile with similar results. The root mean square error (RMSE) range of soil water content was 0.71\textendash{}4.67\% for barley and 2.32\textendash{}6.77\% for wheat, depending on the model and soil type. None of the models simulated total soil water content in the profile significantly better, but there was a general tendency for the models to overestimate soil water depletion. Both CERES and SWAP mimicked the soil water content dynamics well in the top 0.3 m of the soil. The study shows that the multiple layer approach models (SWAP or CERES) including more sophisticated estimation methods for root growth and soil water extraction should be preferred in comparable environments. Further adjustments of evapotranspiration subroutines to the local conditions should be considered prior to the model use for drought impact assessment, yield forecasting or climate change impact studies.},

Data are presented for trials carried out during the 1987 first ratoon and these are compared with published data from the previous 1986 plant cane season. In both years soil evaporation was substantial, ranging from 15 to 70\% of total evaporation, depending on canopy cover. The ability of the sugar cane to compete with the maize for light and water was very different in the two years. The total water requirement of the mixed crop, estimated using potential evaporation and crop factors, was frequently very different from the measured crop water use. Throughout both seasons the water use of the maize was consistently underestimated and that of the cane overestimated.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.compag.2011.10.020},
  abstract = {Assessing the environmental impacts of agricultural practices at the catchment scale increasingly involves the use of spatially distributed models that include cropping systems as input. Use of these models for diagnosis and evaluation requires large datasets at large spatial and temporal scales. The description of spatial dynamics of cropping systems at a fine resolution (i.e. field level) is particularly needed. As these data are scarce or not available, our objective was to propose a model that first reconstructs spatial dynamics of past cropping systems from available data, and second constructs alternative spatial cropping systems, corresponding to agricultural practice scenarios. Classification systems for farms and fertilisation practices were defined to classify farm-level organisation for crop-succession and crop management strategies, in particular nitrogen fertilisation. Winter cover crops and multiple strategies per crop at the farm level can be represented with this model. Cropping systems are modelled in three steps: we modelled crop cover succession in summer with Markov chains based on empirical data and in winter with rules based on expert agronomic knowledge; lastly a Knapsack-based algorithm was used to allocate a crop management system to fields with constraints on several crop management strategies per crop type. Results of a case study performed on the Fr{\'e}meur catchment (western France) show that this model respects the main constraints for cropping system modelling to assess agricultural practices at the catchment scale. From a scenario discussed with stakeholders and regional authorities characterised by stable areas of summer crops, the decrease in bare soil area in winter and overall reduction in total nitrogen fertilisation for different types of crops and farms we demonstrate the model's ability to simulate coherent cropping systems. Thus, if faced with a lack of data or knowledge about the local factors that drive changes in cropping systems, the model can construct the spatial dynamics of cropping systems, which can be used as input to distributed nitrate transfer models to assess agricultural practices at the catchment scale.},

This study examines the applicability of the ORYZA2000 model in analyzing impact of water-related options on rice yield and water use for enhancing water productivity in irrigated environments of Punjab. Performance of the model was reasonably good as indicated by close matching between simulated harvest-time grain yield, biomass, and soil profile water use with measured data and trends of simulated water balance components for a range of soil and water management scenarios. Using long-term weather data, cumulative probability distribution of simulated grain yield and evapotranspiration (ET) showed that rice yield of late-transplanted (July 1) crop was comparable to that of early-transplanted (May 16) crop, and ET-based water productivity was greater in late-planted crop. Though ET-based water productivity with continuous submergence and 2-day interval regimes were comparable, water-input-based productivity was greater under 2-day interval regime. Increasing puddling intensity from P1 (puddling once) to P2 (puddling two times) and P4 (puddling four times) regimes had little effect on ET-based water productivity, but caused a substantial increase in water-input-based productivity.},

  abstract = {Under low and poorly distributed rainfall higher food production can be achieved by increasing crop water use efficiency (WUE) through optimum soil fertility management and selection of deep-rooting cultivars, appropriate plant density and planting dates. We explored AquaCrop's applicability in selecting adaptive practices for improving maize yield and WUE under rainfed smallholder farming in semi-arid Zimbabwe. AquaCrop was first tested using field measurements without calibration. The model was subsequently applied to estimate the effect of effective rooting depth (ERD), plant density and planting date on maize yield. Simulations were done with daily rainfall data for 25 seasons. During model testing AquaCrop simulated canopy cover development well and simulated biomass accumulation showed good agreement with measured values. The model overestimated soil water, and observed final biomass and grain yield were 96 and 92\% of simulated values, respectively. Model application showed that increasing ERD from 0.40 m at 32,500 plants ha-1 to 0.60 m at 44,400 plants ha-1 increased grain yield from 6.0 to 7.8 t ha-1, biomass water use efficiency by 20.5\%, grain water use efficiency by 23.6\% and transpiration water use efficiency by 26.8\%. At 0.60 and 0.80 m ERD and 44,400 plants ha-1, biomass and grain yield, and WUE, were similar. Drainage below the rootzone was \ensuremath{\geq}40\% of non-productive water losses in normal and wet seasons whilst soil evaporation contributed 47\% in dry seasons at 0.80 m ERD. To improve yield and WUE, we recommend: incorporation of deep-rooting legumes, deeper-rooting cultivars (\ensuremath{\geq}0.60 m effective rooting depth) and practices that improve ERD, a plant density of 44,400 plants ha-1; and practices that reduce soil evaporation e.g. mulching and addition of organic fertilisers to improve soils' available water capacity and enhance response to mineral fertilisers. Further research should include field testing of results from this study with farmers.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable of the climate system. It constrains plant transpiration and photosynthesis in several regions of the world, with consequent impacts on the water, energy and biogeochemical cycles. Moreover it is a storage component for precipitation and radiation anomalies, inducing persistence in the climate system. Finally, it is involved in a number of feedbacks at the local, regional and global scales, and plays a major role in climate-change projections. In this review, we provide a synthesis of past research on the role of soil moisture for the climate system, based both on modelling and observational studies. We focus on soil moisture\textendash{}temperature and soil moisture\textendash{}precipitation feedbacks, and their possible modifications with climate change. We also highlight further impacts of soil moisture on climate, and the state of research regarding the validation of the relevant processes.

There are promises for major advances in this research field in coming years thanks to the development of new validation datasets and multi-model initiatives. However, the availability of ground observations continues to be critical in limiting progress and should therefore strongly be fostered at the international level. Exchanges across disciplines will also be essential for bridging current knowledge gaps in this field. This is of key importance given the manifold impacts of soil moisture on climate, and their relevance for climate-change projections. A better understanding and quantification of the relevant processes would significantly help to reduce uncertainties in future-climate scenarios, in particular with regard to changes in climate variability and extreme events, as well as ecosystem and agricultural impacts.},

  abstract = {This textbook contains the material for a course in the major principles of modelling crop growth processes. There is much more to crop growth than what is discussed in this textbook, but it provides a sound basis for further work and study in this field. Chapter by chapter the book leads the reader to different modelled aspects of crop growth, and at the end, the reader will have a good understanding of the Wageningen simulation model SUCROS for the potential production situation. By then, it will be much easier to find one's way through descriptions and listings of other models. Throughout the text, the study of the different topics is facilitated by exercises that support the course in a hands-on computer practical exercise. A very simple crop growth model, almost entirely based on radiation interception, is given first. This skeleton model is then expanded by submodels for respiration, carbon assimilation, plant development, and a more detailed model for radiation interception and reflection. Modelling of transpiration and the leaf energy balance is given by way of introduction. There are many listings of the submodels, written in the simulation language FST (FORTRAN Simulation Translator), as well as of SUCROS itself, together with plentiful comments. Some supporting theory is provided in the form of Appendices. The book is meant for students and scientists who would like to acquire a working knowledge of the technique of crop growth modelling.},

  volume = {52},

  doi = {10.1623/hysj.52.2.247},
  abstract = {Abstract A global water model is used to analyse the impacts of climate change and socio-economic driving forces (derived from the A2 and B2 scenarios of IPCC) on future global water stress. This work extends previous global water research by analysing not only the impact of climate change and population, but also the effects of income, electricity production, water-use efficiency and other driving forces, on water stress. Depending on the scenario and climate model, water stress increases (between current conditions and the 2050s) over 62.0\textendash{}75.8\% of total river basin area and decreases over 19.7\textendash{}29.0\% of this area. The remaining areas have small changes. The principal cause of decreasing water stress (where it occurs) is the greater availability of water due to increased annual precipitation related to climate change. The principal cause of increasing water stress is growing water withdrawals, and the most important factor for this increase is the growth of domestic water use stimulated by income growth. (Population growth was a much less important factor and irrigated area was assumed to remain constant.) To address the uncertainty of water stress estimates, three different indicators of water stress were computed and compared. The overlap area of their computation of ``severe stress'' in the 2050s was large (approximately 23 \texttimes{} 106 km2 or 56\textendash{}73 \% of the total ``severe stress'' area). This indicates a moderate level of agreement and robustness in estimates of future water stress. At the same time the indicators disagreed in many other areas, suggesting that work is still needed to elaborate general indicators and concepts of water stress.},

  abstract = {The relative yield decline that is expected under specific levels of water stress at different moments in the growing period is estimated by integrating the FAO Ky approach [Doorenbos, J., Kassam, A.H., 1979. Yield response to water. FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 33. Rome, Italy] in the soil water balance model BUDGET. The water stored in the root zone is determined in the soil water balance model on a daily basis by keeping track of incoming and outgoing water fluxes at its boundary. Given the simulated soil water content in the root zone, the corresponding crop water stress is determined. Subsequently, the yield decline is estimated with the Ky approach. In the Ky approach the relation between water stress in a particular growth stage and the corresponding expected yield is described by a linear function. To account for the effect of water stresses in the various growth stages, the multiplicative, seasonal and minimal approach are integrated in the model. To evaluate the model, the simulated yields for two crops under various levels of water stress in two different environments were compared with observed yields: winter wheat under three different water application levels in the North of Tunisia, and maize in three different farmers' fields in different years in the South West of Burkina Faso. Simulated crop yields agreed well with observed yields for both locations using the multiplicative approach. The correlation value (R2) between observed and simulated yields ranged from 0.87 to 0.94 with very high modeling efficiencies. The root mean square error values are relatively small and ranged between 7 and 9\%. The minimal and seasonal approaches performed significantly less accurately in both of the study areas. Estimation of yields on basis of relative transpiration performed significantly better than estimations on basis of relative evapotranspiration in Burkina Faso. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model is robust and that good estimates can be obtained in both regions even by using indicative values for the required crop and soil parameters. The minimal input requirement, the robustness of the model and its ability to describe the effect on seasonal yield of water stress occurring at particular moments in the growing period, make the model very useful for the design of deficit irrigation strategies. BUDGET is public domain software and hence freely available. An installation disk and manual can be downloaded from the web.},

  abstract = {Winter wheat is the main crop on the North China Plain (NCP), and in this region the most limiting factor for the crop is water. The objective of this study was to adapt and test the ability of the FAO-developed AquaCrop model (v3.1) to simulate winter wheat grain yield, biomass, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and total soil water content (0\textendash{}120 cm). Field experiments were conducted under deficit irrigation at the Luancheng Agro-ecosystem station (NCP) in 1998\textendash{}2001, and the AquaCrop model was calibrated with treatment D (1999\textendash{}2000); the rest of the data was used for validation of the model. The AquaCrop model was revalidated with data on measured grain yield from the experimental station for 1990\textendash{}2010, considering actual field conditions. The second revalidation was done with the statistical grain yield for 1995\textendash{}2010 in the study region. For the model validation, the significant differences between simulated and observed grain yield, biomass and ETa were in the order of: rainfed treatment \ensuremath{>} well-watered treatment \ensuremath{>} moderate water stress. Total soil water simulated by AquaCrop tends to follow closely the trend in the measured data, but with slight underestimations for irrigated treatments and significant overestimations for rainfed treatments. In general, errors in the model's evaluation such as RMSE and Willmot's d statistics were for grain yield (0.58 Mg ha-1, 0.92), biomass (0.87 Mg ha-1, 0.95), ETa (33.2 mm, 0.93) and soil water content (24.5\textendash{}37.6 mm, 0.85\textendash{}0.90). The overall results based on extensive validation and revalidation showed that AquaCrop is a valid model and can be used with a reliable degree of accuracy for optimizing winter wheat grain yield production and water requirement on the NCP.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2009.06.020},
  abstract = {In the Bolivian Altiplano, the yields of rainfed quinoa are relatively low and highly unstable. We use a validated crop water productivity model to examine the potential of closing quinoa yield gaps in this region. We simulate the expectable yields under rainfed cultivation and under different deficit irrigation (DI) strategies using the AquaCrop model for the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano. Simulated DI scenarios include a reference strategy avoiding stomatal closure during all sensitive growth stages and allowing drought stress during the tolerant growth stages (DI0) and various restrictive deficit irrigation strategies (DIi) representing cases when water resources are limited. We obtain a logistic crop water production function for quinoa by plotting the seasonal actual evapotranspiration versus total grain yield. Due to the large scatter, this function only indicatively provides expectable yields. From the scenario analysis, we derive yield probability curves for the 3 agro-climatic regions. DI, without restriction in irrigation water during the drought sensitive growth stages, is able to close the yield gaps in the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, and would guarantee a high and stable level of water productivity (WP). The yields of quinoa under rainfed cultivation during dry years are only 1.1, 0.5 and 0.2 Mg ha-1 in the Northern, Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, whereas under DI0 they are 2.2, 1.6 and 1.5 Mg ha-1, respectively. Under limited water availability for irrigation, these stable yield levels decrease, most drastically in the Southern Bolivian Altiplano. Below a minimum water availability of 600 m3 per ha and 700 m3 per ha in the Central and Southern Bolivian Altiplano, respectively, the application of DI for quinoa is not significantly effective and should be avoided to save valuable resources. The yield probability curves we derive can serve as input for stochastic economic analysis of DI of quinoa in the Bolivian Altiplano.},

The canopy cover,total dry matter, dry matter of tubers and evapotranspiration were the primary variables analyzed. Anacceptable goodness of fit was found between observed and simulated values. So, statistical indicatorssuch as the Willmott index of agreement (d) and the coefficient of determination (R2) showed good values(d and R2\ensuremath{>} 0.90) for the primary variables analyzed. Both the model and the observed data found that80\% and 60\% of the water requirements were the treatments that were most efficient in the use of water.A high temperature stress coefficient affecting the harvest index is recommended to be incorporated inthe model for avoiding overestimations of yield.},

  abstract = {Severity\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency (SDF) curves are very useful in the analysis of drought phenomena. Station-level information obtained from SDF curves can be interpolated to obtain severity maps for fixed return period, in order to jointly analyse the spatial variability of drought characteristics (e.g. severity, duration and frequency). This approach is limited because the severity is usually quantified through indices that use hydrological and meteorological data, depending on the type of requirements. Therefore, drought indices can only reflect hydrological conditions, but are unable to quantify economic losses associated with droughts. In other words, SDF curves do not allow effective quantification of the impact expected with a certain return period. This paper proposes the methodology drought economic risk assessment (DERA) as an approach that emphasizes the importance of the relationship between a generic drought index (which quantifies water deficit) and the economic impact of the failure to meet water demand. Using integrated SDF curves, this relationship enables drought severity and corresponding impacts to be mapped. This procedure was applied to agricultural droughts (sunflower crop) in Umbria Region (central Italy). The agricultural drought impact variable was identified by sunflower yield (Y); the economic impact variable by net benefit depletion (EL); and the drought index by Relative Severity Index (RSI), which is quantifiable by a soil\textendash{}water balance model. The relationships Y = g(RSI) and EL = f(Y) were specifically determined. Using DERA, it was possible to derive curves for SDF, impact\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency, and economic losses\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency (ELDF), which were then used to map severity, impact and economic losses for the assigned return period and duration. From the ELDF curves, further information was obtained by mapping critical drought durations for the assigned return period and economic loss threshold. The case study supports the potential of the proposed approach, both in the planning and real-time management of drought effects.},

  abstract = {Balancing Water for Humans and Nature, authored by two of the world's leading experts on water management, examines water flows - the 'blood stream' of both nature and society - in terms of the crucial links, balances, conflicts and trade-offs between human and environmental needs. The authors argue that a sustainable future depends fundamentally on our ability to manage these trade-offs and encourage long-term resilience. They advocate an ecohydrological approach to land/water/environmental problems and advance a strong, reasoned argument for viewing precipitation as the gross fresh water resource, ultimately responsible for sustaining all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem services.This book makes the most coherent and holistic argument to date for a new ecological approach to understanding and managing water resources for the benefit of all. Basing their analysis on per capita needs for an acceptable nutritional diet, the authors analyse predictions of the amounts of water needed for global food production by 2050 and identify potential sources. Drawing on small-scale experiences in Africa and Asia, they also cover the vulnerability of the semi-arid tropics through a simplified model of green and blue water scarcity components.},

The models are important aids in understanding, predicting and managing these systems. Such models are complex and imperfect. One fundamental research direction is to seek a better understanding of how these systems function, and to propose mathematical expressions embodying that understanding. However, this is not sufficient. It is also essential to have tools (often mathematical and statistical methods) to aid in developing, improving and using the models built from those equations. The book is specifically concerned with the application of methods to crop models, but much of the material is also applicable to dynamic system models in other fields.

  abstract = {* Previous studies have concluded that spatial aggregation of conspecifics should benefit weak competitors and put stronger competitors at a disadvantage, thus promoting plant species coexistence. However, if competitive ability is viewed as a behavioural trait, it becomes evident that traits determining spatial patterns and competitive ability could co-evolve, resulting in greater dispersal in stronger competitors and reduced competitive ability in spatially aggregated species.

* To test this prediction, we combined spatial data from a field survey of seven temperate grassland communities with the results of a common-garden competition experiment involving 28 focal species.

* We found that species exhibiting strong conspecific aggregation and infrequent heterospecific encounters in the field maintained greater growth in competition with conspecifics than with heterospecifics. In contrast, species that mostly encountered heterospecific neighbours in the field achieved greater growth when surrounded by heterospecific than conspecific neighbours, indicating greater competitive ability. The observed patterns of conspecific aggregation were related to variation in clonal dispersal characteristics and there was a direct positive relationship between clonal dispersal distance and competitive ability.

* Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that viewing competitive ability as a behavioural trait that imposes different costs and benefits on an individual depending on the identity of its neighbours can provide new insights into the long-debated topic of mechanisms promoting plant species coexistence.},

  abstract = {Better water management will be crucial if we are to meet many of the key challenges of this century - feeding the world's growing population and reducing poverty, meeting water and sanitation needs, protecting vital ecosystems, all while adapting to climate change. The approach known as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is widely recognized as the best way forward, but is poorly understood, even within the water sector. Since a core IWRM principle is that good water management must involve the water users, the understanding and involvement of other sectors is critical for success. There is thus an urgent need for practical guidance, for both water and development professionals, based on real world examples, rather than theoretical constructs. That is what this book provides. Using case studies, the book illustrates how better water management, guided by the IWRM approach, has helped to meet a wide range of sustainable development goals. It does this by considering practical examples, looking at how IWRM has contributed, at different scales, from very local, village-level experiences to reforms at national level and beyond to cases involving trans-boundary river basins. Using these on-the-ground experiences, from both developed and developing countries in five continents, the book provides candid and practical lessons for policy-makers, donors, and water and development practitioners worldwide, looking at how IWRM principles were applied, what worked, and, equally important, what didn't work, and why.

  abstract = {Crop growth simulation models of varying complexity have been developed to predict the effects of soil, water, nutrients and climate on biomass and grain yields and water use efficiency of different crops. In this study, the AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for rice crop growth modeling under different irrigation water regimes at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, Gazipur, Bangladesh during the 2008\textendash{}09 and 2009\textendash{}10 winter (dry) seasons. Three irrigation water regimes were examined: irrigation with continuous standing water (CSW), and irrigation at 3 or 5 days after water disappearance (3 or 5 DAWD) from the field as potential water saving adaptations. Model performance was evaluated in terms of prediction error (Pe), coefficient of determination (R2), the normalized root mean squared error (NRSME), the Nash\textendash{}Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (EF) and Willmott's index of agreement (d). The model calibration yielded 0.94 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.99, 14.5 \&lt; NRMSE \&lt; 21.6, 0.83 \&lt; EF \&lt; 0.95 and 0.97 \&lt; d \&lt; 0.99 in simulating canopy cover (CC) percentage and above-ground biomass. Model validation yielded 0.98 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.99, 8.6 \&lt; NRMSE \&lt; 12.9, 0.94 \&lt; EF \&lt; 0.97 and d = 0.99 in simulating CC percentage and above-ground biomass. In calibration and validation, respectively, the prediction errors for grain yield varied from 5.55 to 7.70\% and 8.22 to 11.54\%, and for biomass production from 2.62 to 5.19\% and 7.95 to 11.15\%, indicating good model performances. Based on crop yield, water use and its use efficiency, the IR69515-KKN-4-UBN-4-2-1-1 genotype showed better productivity in the dry season under the 3 DAWD irrigation water regime compared to the other examined treatments, which was shown by both the experimental data and the model simulations using FAO recommended conservative model parameters. The FAO AquaCrop model was able to predict rice growth and yield with acceptable accuracy under different water regimes, making this model a suitable candidate to facilitate local scenario studies related to irrigation scheduling, yield prediction or studies related to climate change and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Crop models require different structures for different applications. Modular and flexible crop modelling frameworks, such as the recently developed agricultural production and externalities simulator (APES), support the change of model structure. However, the assembly of different modules to create a model may not always result in the best model structure. We developed and tested a protocol for a systematic selection and evaluation of a crop growth model structure. The novelty of the presented protocol relies on a throughout analysis of the different modelling approaches (modules) and on how to assemble them to create new modelling solutions (i.e. model). We use a case study to demonstrate that we can explicitly express and test the different assumptions behind the choice of a specific modelling approach. Our case study refers to the simulation of crop growth in response to nitrogen management and the importance of an accurate simulation of the nitrogen uptake. Applying the proposed protocol, we identify the need to improve the initially selected nitrogen mineralisation module. We conclude that not only is the protocol suitable to provide guidance for systematic testing of different crop processes modelled, but also its use highlights the importance of the documentation of the modelling process and of the clarification of the uncertainty associated with the model structure.},

  abstract = {The need for more agricultural areas stemming from population pressure has been contributing to the increased forest and grassland-to-agricultural areas conversion in recent years in the upper Mara River Basin, Kenya. The deforestation of the Mau forest and settlement on hydrological sensitive areas of the watershed along with poor soil and water conservation practices have caused the high level of soil erosion and water quality deterioration. The various efforts to curve down this problem necessitate the knowledge of the rate of erosion, surface runoff as a function of the physical and hydrometeorological characteristics of the watershed. In support of this effort, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of three land-use/land cover practices on runoff and sediment yield using runoff plots and two models: Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) and Erosion 3D. In order to accomplish these objectives, runoff plots were established at three sites: Amala upstream; Amala downstream and Nyangores watersheds. In all of the three watersheds, three land uses (cropland, grassland and bare land) with similar slope steepness and soil types were considered. Using the data collected from the runoff plots, the WEPP and Erosion 3D models were evaluated. The plot scale research results indicated that erosion was high in all of the sites on cultivated lands. The highest total sediment yield over the study period was observed on cultivated land (162.38 g/m2) in the Nyangores watershed; and the lowest sediment yield (29.95 g/m2) was observed on grassland at Amala downstream site. The model evaluation indicated that both of the models perform well in estimation of runoff, however, the WEPP model performs better than Erosion 3D in estimation of soil erosion.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, farming systems modelling has become an accessible tool for developing intervention strategies targeted at smallholder farmers in southern Africa. Applying the Agricultural Productions Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to credibly simulate key soil and crop processes in highly constrained, low yielding maize/legume systems has led to four distinct modes of use: (i) to add value to field experimentation and demonstration; (ii) in direct engagement with farmers; (iii) to explore key system constraints and opportunities with researchers and extension agencies; and (iv) in the generation of information for policy makers, bankers and insurance institutions. Examples of application in each of these modes are presented. Despite being demonstrated as an excellent tool for developing intervention strategies and extension material, the use of simulation is limited by a lack of competent local users. Better co-operation within the simulation community, sharing of climate, soil and crop parameterisation and validation datasets, and focussing of efforts on using models to benefit smallholder farmers are suggested as ways of increasing the use and relevance of simulation. Substantial investment in the training of agriculturalists and the further science development of systems simulation is required to tackle the enormous challenges facing agricultural development in the region.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of climate change on winter and summer rice (Oryza sativa) yield and evaluates several adaptation measures to overcome the negative impact of climate change on rice production in the Quang Nam province of Vietnam. Future climate change scenarios for time periods in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were projected by downscaling the outputs of the General Circulation Model (GCM), Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3) A2 and B2 scenarios. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the impact of future climates on rice yield. The minimum and maximum temperature of the province is projected to increase by 0.35\textendash{}1.72 \ensuremath{^\circ}C and 0.93\textendash{}3.69 \ensuremath{^\circ}C respectively in future. Similarly, the annual precipitation is expected to increase by 9.75 \% in the 2080s. Results show that climate change will reduce rice yield from 1.29 to 23.05 \% during the winter season for both scenarios and all time periods, whereas an increase in yield by 2.07 to 6.66 \% is expected in the summer season for the 2020s and 2050s; relative to baseline yield. The overall decrease of rice yield in the winter season can be offset, and rice yield in the summer season can be enhanced to potential levels by altering the transplanting dates and by introducing supplementary irrigation. Late transplanting of rice shows an increase of yield by 20\textendash{}27 \% in future. Whereas supplementary irrigation of rice in the winter season shows an increase in yield of up to 42 \% in future. Increasing the fertilizer application rate enhances the yield from 0.3 to 29.8 \% under future climates. Similarly, changing the number of doses of fertilizer application increased rice yield by 1.8 to 5.1 \%, relative to the current practice of single dose application. Shifting to other heat tolerant varieties also increased the rice production. Based on the findings, changing planting dates, supplementary irrigation, proper nutrient management and adopting to new rice cultivars can be beneficial for the adaptation of rice cultivation under climate change scenarios in central Vietnam.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2007.11.008},
  abstract = {Agriculture needs to increase its production with a small amount of available fresh water. Deficit irrigation (DI) is now widely been investigated as one of the solutions for this problem. The effects of concentrated drought stress in various phenological stages of quinoa on total production were assessed in above-ground mini-lysimeters under controlled conditions in the Bolivian Altiplano. From the results of the controlled experiment a promising DI strategy was obtained which consisted in mitigating droughts during plant establishment and during the reproductive stage (flowering and early grain filling). The DI strategy was tested in the field by respecting local agricultural practices and compared with full irrigation (FI) and rainfed treatments. The field experiments were conducted in two locations in the central Bolivian Altiplano (Patacamaya and Condoriri) and in two cropping seasons (2005\textendash{}2006, and 2006\textendash{}2007). The performance of quinoa in all experiments was assessed by measuring total seed yield, seed size, harvest index (HI) and water use efficiency (WUE). From the controlled experiment, the negative effect of continuous drought was demonstrated. The milky grain phase was observed as being most sensitive to drought stress, followed by the flowering stage. Drought stress after emergence till the 6-leaf stage and from the 6-leaf stage till the 12-leaf stage did not cause lower yields and resulted in equal or higher WUE than FI. In Condoriri no significant differences were found between the DI and rainfed treatment as a result of the good rainfall distribution during the critical phenological stages. The DI strategy in Patacamaya in 2005\textendash{}2006 resulted in significantly higher yields (2 Mg/ha) and 1000 seed mass (5.5 g) as compared to the rainfed treatment (1.7 Mg/ha and 4.2 g, respectively). The field experiment of 2006\textendash{}2007 indicated that additional irrigation during the late vegetative stage is redundant and that a DI strategy with irrigation only during plant establishment is insufficient. A significant, negative linear relation was demonstrated in the mini-lysimeter and field experiments between pre- and post-anthesis ETa and WUE, indicating the extra harmful character of droughts during flowering and grain filling if the crop did not suffer drought stress before flowering. From the field results, former studies and observations in farmers' fields, indicative values for the net irrigation requirement, expected yields and WUE for various management conditions, irrigation applications and for different types of years were derived. It is believed that quinoa yields can be stabilized at 1.2 up to 2 Mg/ha with the help of DI by applying only half of the irrigation water required for full irrigation.},

  abstract = {tIn semi-arid environments vegetation density and distribution is of considerable importance for thehydrological water balance. A number of hydrological models exploit Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps retrievedby remote sensing as a measure of the vegetation cover, in order to enhance the evaluation of evapotran-spiration and interception losses.On the other hand, actual evapotranspiration and vegetation development can be derived through cropgrowth models, such as AquaCrop, developed by FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), which allowsthe simulation of the canopy development of the main field crops. We used MODIS LAI images to calibrateAquaCrop according to the canopy cover development of winter wheat. With this aim we exploited anempirical relationship between LAI and canopy cover. In detail Aquacrop was calibrated with MODIS LAImaps collected between 2008 and 2011, and validated with reference to MODIS LAI maps of 2013\textendash{}2014 inRocchetta Sant'Antonio and Sant'Agata, two test sites in the Carapelle watershed, Southern Italy. Results,in terms of evaluation of canopy cover, provided improvements. For example, for Rocchetta Sant'Antonio,the statistical indexes varyfrom r = 0.40, ER = 0.22, RMSE = 17.28 and KGE = 0.31 (using the model withoutcalibration), to r = 0.86, ER = 0.08, RMSE = 6.01 and KGE 0.85 (after calibration).},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2014.08.001},
  abstract = {This work investigated the performance of AquaCrop and CropSyst in simulating barley growth under three water treatments (full irrigation, 50\% irrigation and rainfed) and two nitrogen levels (high and low) with a particular attention to the influence of calibration year on the modelling results. Three years (2006\textendash{}2008) of data from the experimental work carried out in Southern Italy were used. The models were calibrated for each of three years and then validated for two other years. The overall results pointed out that both models could be calibrated with data of one of any the three years and validated with all other data. Nevertheless, errors of estimate slightly changed in respect to the year of calibration and were sensitive, from one year to another, to weather conditions and different water and nitrogen regimes. The results indicated AquaCrop superior than CropSyst when the calibration was done on the basis of 2006 and 2008 data, whereas the models performed in a similar way when the calibration was done for 2007. In the case of final biomass, the relative RMSE was lower for AquaCrop (from 0.09 to 0.15) than for CropSyst (from 0.15 to 0.17). Similarly, in the case of final yield, the relative RMSE of AquaCrop was lower (from 0.11 to 0.17) than that of CropSyst (from 0.16 to 0.23). AquaCrop overestimated final biomass by 0.18 and 0.27 t ha-1 for 2006 and 2008 calibration year, respectively, and underestimated biomass by 1.02 t ha-1 when calibration was done on 2007 data. CropSyst underestimated biomass independently on the calibration year, from 0.83 to 1.26 t ha-1.},

More than 30 potato models, two sweet potato models, and three yam models are described in the literature, and each differ in model structure. Some potato models have been applied to studies of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact, but most of these models have never been validated with field measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested with some field data. LPOTCO and AQUACROP are two potato models that have been tested under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. None of the models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data. The most tested and applied potato models include versions of LINTUL and SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, MADHURAM and SPOTCOMS, and two yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato, sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii) tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature, heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam research.},

Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was compared to manure, ashes, combinations of those, 1/2 Tithonia 1/2 DAP (TD) and no input. 1/3rd of the labour was saved when placing seeds in trenches as compared to individual holes without losing significant grain yield. Broadcasting requires 1/9th of the planting time while losing only 15\% grain. 5\% grain was lost by weeding once instead of twice, while saving 36\% of the time. The time saved at planting can be more productively invested in collecting inputs. Plots without input yielded 537 kg ha-1 grain and 642 kg ha-1 biomass in 2006. Inputs increased both grain and biomass yields significantly with 27\textendash{}51\%, without significant difference between local and mineral inputs (with exception of TD). Using local input is thus a reasonable decision for farmers. Farmers concluded that the experiments had led to options for different types of farmers, with different access to resources, to increase their soybean production.},

  doi = {10.1017/S0021859614000872},
  abstract = {SUMMARY Most crop models make use of a nutrient-balance approach for modelling crop response to soil fertility. To counter the vast input data requirements that are typical of these models, the crop water productivity model AquaCrop adopts a semi-quantitative approach. Instead of providing nutrient levels, users of the model provide the soil fertility level as a model input. This level is expressed in terms of the expected impact on crop biomass production, which can be observed in the field or obtained from statistics of agricultural production. The present study is the first to describe extensively, and to calibrate and evaluate, the semi-quantitative approach of the AquaCrop model, which simulates the effect of soil fertility stress on crop production as a combination of slower canopy expansion, reduced maximum canopy cover, early decline in canopy cover and lower biomass water productivity. AquaCrop's fertility response algorithms are evaluated here against field experiments with tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) in Ethiopia, with maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Nepal, and with quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) in Bolivia. It is demonstrated that AquaCrop is able to simulate the soil water content in the root zone, and the crop's canopy development, dry above-ground biomass development, final biomass and grain yield, under different soil fertility levels, for all four crops. Under combined soil water stress and soil fertility stress, the model predicts final grain yield with a relative root-mean-square error of only 11\textendash{}13\% for maize, wheat and quinoa, and 34\% for tef. The present study shows that the semi-quantitative soil fertility approach of the AquaCrop model performs well and that the model can be applied, after case-specific calibration, to the simulation of crop production under different levels of soil fertility stress for various environmental conditions, without requiring detailed field observations on soil nutrient content.},

  abstract = {In a semi-arid environment, the main challenge for crop production is water deficit. FAO's AquaCrop model, which simulates yield response to water, has been calibrated to explore alternative water management strategies in teff crop. To calibrate and evaluate this model, we used independent data sets of the cropping season 2008 and 2009 in the northern Ethiopia. The teff crop cover, biomass and soil water simulated by the model agreed well with the observed data. The model revealed that the grain-water use efficiency of teff increased when supplementary irrigation after start of flowering was increased from 0 to 95 mm. The biomass-water use efficiency showed the opposite trend: it decreased. The implication of these results is that if land is not a constraint, and if the intention is to grow teff for its biomass, the best option is to use the available water to grow teff with deficit irrigation. But when the major intention is to produce grain, the best option is an optimum irrigation application. It is concluded that the AquaCrop model can be used to explore management options to improve teff water productivity in the area.},

  abstract = {Development of integrated weed management systems requires the integration of different weed control methods: chemical, mechanical, cultural, genetic, and biological. Mathematical models provide an adequate tool for attaining this objective. An explanatory economic model was built to analyze the ecophysiological aspects of wild oats (Avena fatua L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) competitive ability, and to determine the impact of cultural and genetic control on chemical control of wild oats in irrigated barley. The competitive ability of both species was highly dependent on light interception during early growth rather than photosynthesis. Integration of genetic, cultural, and chemical control, accomplished by simulation, showed a good possibility for reducing herbicide use by using more competitive barley cultivars and planting them at higher seeding rates.},

  abstract = {Organic resources play a critical role in both short-term nutrient availability and longer-term maintenance of soil organic matter in most smaller holder farming systems in the tropics. Despite this importance, there is little predictive understanding for the management of organic inputs in tropical agroecosystems. In this paper, an organic resource database (ORD) is introduced that contains information on organic resource quality parameters including macronutrient, lignin and polyphenol contents of fresh leaves, litter, stems and/or roots from almost 300 species found in tropical agroecosystems. Data on the soil and climate from where the material was collected are also included, as are decomposition and nutrient release rates of many of the organic inputs. Examples of uses of ORD are provided in the paper: (1) nutrient contents (including median values and ranges) and other resource quality parameters of farmyard manure and crop residues are compared to that of alternative nutrient sources such as different plant parts and plant types; (2) nutrient stocks found in farm boundary hedges are estimated and evaluated as a source of nutrients for soil fertility management; (3) hypotheses regarding the indices and critical values of N, lignin, and polyphenol contents for predicting N release rates are tested; (4) organic materials for soil fertility management experiments are selected. This database, when coupled with models and decision support tools, will help advance organic matter management for soil fertility improvement from an empirical to a predictive practice.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2007.02.002},
  abstract = {A methodology has been developed to quantify spatial variation of crop yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and water productivity (WPET) using the SEBAL algorithm and high and low resolution satellite images. SEBAL-based ET estimates were validated over an irrigated, wheat dominated area in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico and proved to be accurate (8.8\% difference for 110 days). Estimated average wheat yields in Yaqui Valley of 5.5 t ha-1 were well within the range of measured yields reported in the literature. Measured wheat yields in 24 farmers' fields in Sirsa district, India, were 0.4 t ha-1 higher than SEBAL estimated wheat yields. Area average WPET in the Yaqui Valley was 1.37 kg m-3 and could be considered to be high as compared to other irrigated systems around the world where the same methodology was applied. A higher average WPET was found in Egypt's Nile Delta (1.52 kg m-3), Kings County (CA), USA (1.44 kg m-3) and in Oldambt, The Netherlands (1.39 kg m-3). The spatial variability of WPET within low productivity systems (CV = 0.33) is higher than in high productivity systems (CV = 0.05) because water supply in the former case is uncertain and farming conditions are sub-optimal. The high CV found in areas with low WPET indicates that there is considerable scope for improvement. The average scope for improvement in eight systems was 14\%, indicating that 14\% ET reduction can be achieved while maintaining the same yield. It is concluded that the proposed methodology is accurate and that better knowledge of the spatial variation of WPET provides valuable information for achieving local water conservation practices in irrigated wheat.},

  abstract = {Any satisfactory computer simulation model of a soil process must match actual behaviour in the laboratory or field; a model can be evaluated by how well it does so. This paper describes a method for assessing models using anion diffusion and nitrate leaching as examples. The method partitions the sum of squares of the differences between measurement and simulation into two components, one calculated from the differences between the simulation and the mean of replicate measurements (the `lack of fit'), and the other calculated from the variance within each set of replicate measurements (the `pure error'). If the former is not significantly larger than the latter than the data present no grounds for rejecting the model. Where a model simulates the change in a process with time the method can also take account of how experimental error in the initial measurements affects the goodness of fit of the simulation of subsequent measurements.The method is particularly valuable where it is difficult or costly to take many replicate measurements, such as often happens in soil science or agriculture; nonetheless, some replicates must be taken.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00271-014-0444-2},
  abstract = {This paper reports on a study combining experimental field data with biophysical crop modelling to assess the impacts of irrigation heterogeneity on onion yield. The AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for brown onion (cv Arthur) and used to simulate yield variability under a set of contrasting soil and agroclimatic conditions assuming perfect (100 \% uniform) irrigation. The impacts of non-uniform irrigation as measured on-farm under two overhead systems (mobile hose reel fitted with boom and a linear move) were then evaluated using scenario analysis and multi-model runs. Stochastic modelling confirmed that the lowest yield (8.6 t DM/ha) occurs on the lowest moisture retentive soils under the driest agroclimatic conditions with non-uniform irrigation. There is much greater yield variability in dry years compared to wet years. In wet years, rainfall reduces the scheduled number of irrigation events and buffers the effects of irrigation non-uniformity on yield. Yields were more variable under the mobile hose reel system fitted with the boom compared to the fixed linear move system. The modelled yield variability under non-uniform was similar to the observed yields reported by growers based on an industry survey. The study highlights the importance of achieving high irrigation uniformity in dry years on light soils to maximise yield and provides useful data for evaluating the potential yield benefits that might accrue from precision irrigation.},

performed in farmers' fields. The AquaCrop model was evaluated to predict the effect of deficit irrigation
and rainfed conditions on yield, soil water content and percentage of green canopy cover. The mean normalized
mean root square error for comparison between the measured and predicted values for canopy
cover percentage, soil water content, and grain yield were 8.7, 12.4 and 9.2\%, respectively, that showed
good model accuracy. Efficiency of the model in yield estimation, soil water content and green canopy
cover percentage were 0.91, 0.8 and 0.98, respectively. Agreement index for yield was close to 1.0 that
showed compatibility of these predicted values with actual values. The results showed that the AquaCrop
model is appropriate tool to simulate barley yield under rainfed and deficit irrigation conditions in the
study area. This model is a suitable tool to determine sowing date in rainfed conditions based on first
effective rain.},

  abstract = {The design and implementation of effective environmental policies need to be informed by a holistic understanding of the system processes (biophysical, social and economic), their complex interactions, and how they respond to various changes. Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.},

  abstract = {We conducted experiments in 2006 and 2007 in south-western Kenya to reduce labour and input cost of soybean production through different planting systems (point-placement was compared to planting in trenches and broadcasting), weeding frequencies (once or twice), and the use of local inputs (at 20 kg P ha-1). Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was compared to manure, ashes, combinations of those, 1/2 Tithonia 1/2 DAP (TD) and no input. 1/3rd of the labour was saved when placing seeds in trenches as compared to individual holes without losing significant grain yield. Broadcasting requires 1/9th of the planting time while losing only 15\% grain. 5\% grain was lost by weeding once instead of twice, while saving 36\% of the time. The time saved at planting can be more productively invested in collecting inputs. Plots without input yielded 537 kg ha-1 grain and 642 kg ha-1 biomass in 2006. Inputs increased both grain and biomass yields significantly with 27\textendash{}51\%, without significant difference between local and mineral inputs (with exception of TD). Using local input is thus a reasonable decision for farmers. Farmers concluded that the experiments had led to options for different types of farmers, with different access to resources, to increase their soybean production.},

  abstract = {In a semi-arid environment, the main challenge for crop production is water limitation in space and in time. Considered as appropriate tools, models are used to evaluate the effects of water deficit on crop productivity for better irrigation planning and sustainable yield. The AquaCrop model was tested using data collected during a 4-year experiment on soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. The model was found to accurately simulate final crop biomass, yield and cumulative evapotranspiration: in fact the Wilmot index of agreement (IoA) values were 0.97, 0.96 and 0.96, respectively, for soybean and 0.93, 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, for sunflower, while the relative RMSE was 0.04, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively, for soybean and 0.04, 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, for sunflower. The analysis of irrigation scenarios showed that the early planting of sunflower could demonstrate a greater efficiency than late sowing. In addition, applying three irrigations, of 100 mm each, prior to flowering, at mid flowering stage and at the beginning of seed formation could lead to highest yields (ranging between 4.51 and 2.34 t ha(-1)) and crop water productivity (CWP) (ranging between 1.5 and 0.78 kg m(-3)). Sunflower yields were low (0.42 t ha(-1) to 0.37 t ha())(-1) and unreliable when one single irrigation was performed only at the beginning of seed formation, while highest values (ranging between 1.97 and 1.74 t ha(-1)) were obtained when it was done prior to flowering. The highest yields and crop water productivity for soybean were obtained when the crop was sown in April and by applying three irrigations, of 100 mm each, at full bloom, at seed enlargement and at mature seeds. Soybean yield values ranged between 3.16 and 2.01 t ha(-1), while CWP values varied from 1.05 to 0.67 kg m(-3). However, irrigating at seed enlargement and mature seeds, as well as applying only one irrigation of 100 mm at any growth stage, could lead to very low yields and CWP.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2014.01.014},
  abstract = {Mitigating nutrient loss is a prerequisite of sustainable agriculture in the tropics. We evaluated three soil and water conservation technologies (mulching, minimum tillage and tied ridging) for two cropping seasons (long rains 2011, short rains 2011) at two sites in the central highlands of Kenya. The objectives were: to determine effects of the technologies on runoff, sediment yield and nutrient loads in sediment, and to assess influence of the technologies on maize yields. Experimental design was a randomized complete block with 3 treatments replicated thrice. At the beginning of experiment, soil was sampled at 0\textendash{}15 cm depth and analyzed for pH, N, P, K, C, Ca and Mg. Mulch was applied at a rate of 5 t ha-1. Runoff was sampled, sediments extracted by drying in oven at 105 \ensuremath{^\circ}C, and analyzed for NPK and C loads. Data were subjected to analysis of variance using SAS 9.1.3 and means separated using Fishers' LSD at 5\% level of significance. Results showed reduced nutrient losses with the technologies. In Meru South, sediment yield was reduced by 41 and 7\% during long rains 2011 (p = 0.03), and by 71 and 68\% during short rains 2011 (p = 0.01) under mulching and minimum tillage, respectively. Runoff and maize yields were positively influenced by mulching. In Mbeere South, sediment yield was lower under soil and water conservation technologies. Runoff was reduced by 52 and 49\% during long rains 2011 and by 51 and 30\% during short rains 2011 under tied ridging and mulching respectively, compared with control. Total crop failure occurred during long rains 2011 due to erratic rains. During short rains 2011 tied ridging and mulching increased maize yield by 94 and 75\%, respectively, compared with control. This study highlights the importance of analyzing soil and water conservation technologies within rain-fed farming systems perspective in response to declining food production and supports a focus on tied ridging and mulching.},

  abstract = {Summary
To account for the high uncertainty in climate change scenarios, it is advisable to include the maximum possible amount of climate model simulations. Since this is not always feasible, impact assessments are inevitably performed with a limited set of scenarios. The development of few synthesised scenarios is a challenge that needs more attention as the number of available climate change simulations grows. Whether these scenarios are representative enough for future climate change is a question that needs addressing. There is thus a vital need for techniques which can carefully examine the climate model simulations and extract representative climate scenarios that facilitate impact studies. This study presents a methodology of constructing tailored scenarios for assessing runoff flows including extreme conditions (peak flows) from an array of future climate change signals of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (ETo) derived from the climate model simulations. The aim of the tailoring process is to generate few scenarios that can optimally represent the spectrum of climate scenarios. These tailored scenarios have the advantage of being few in number as well as having a clear description of the seasonal variation of the climate signals, hence allowing easy interpretation of the implications of future changes. The tailoring process begins with an analysis of the hydrological impacts of the climate change signals from all available climate model simulations in a simplified (computationally less expensive) impact model. The climate change signals are transferred to the rainfall and ETo input series of the impact model based on a quantile perturbation technique that accounts for the changes in extremes. The climate model simulations are then subdivided into high, mean and low hydrological impacts using a quantile change analysis. From this impact classification, the corresponding rainfall and ETo change factors are back-tracked on a seasonal basis to determine rainfall\textendash{}ETo covariation. The established rainfall\textendash{}ETo variations are used to inform the scenario construction process. Additionally, the `back-tracking' of extreme flows from driving scenarios is a useful diagnostic of the physical responses to climate change scenarios. The method is demonstrated through the application of 28 RCM runs and a selected catchment in central Belgium.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of economics of rainwater harvesting by poor farmers in Tanzania. A questionnaire was used to survey 120 households to obtain information on the performance of their enterprises over 6 years (1998\textendash{}2003). The information was mainly based on recollection as few farmers kept detailed records. Actual monitoring and measurements of yield and inputs was done in the farmers' enterprises over 2 years during 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 production seasons. The analysis was done for four categories of rainwater harvesting systems differentiated by the size of catchments from which water is collected and the intensity of concentration and/or storage of the collected rainwater. These categories are: micro-catchments, macro-catchments, macro-catchments linked to road drainage and micro or macro-catchments with a storage pond. Results show that rainwater harvesting for production of paddy rice paid most with returns to labor of more than 12 US\$ per person-day invested. These benefits are very high due to the fact that without rainwater harvesting it is not possible to produce paddy in the study area and rainfed sorghum crop realizes a return to labor of only US\$ 3.7 per person-day during above-average seasons. For the rainwater harvesting systems, those designed to collect water from macro-catchments linked to road drainage, performed best during both categories of seasons. The results also show that contrary to expectations, improving rainwater harvesting systems by adding a storage pond may not lead to increased productivity. Another finding that goes against the widely held belief is that rainwater harvesting results in more benefits during the above-average seasons compared to below-average seasons. It is therefore, concluded that there is a potential for combining rainwater harvesting with improved drainage of roads. The construction of rural roads in semi-arid areas can beneficially be integrated with efforts to increase water availability for agricultural needs.},

  abstract = {tIn model-based irrigation control, the root zone soil moisture deficit (RZSMD) is maintained based on thewater balance. To predict RZSMD in real-time, effective rainfall, irrigation and crop evapotranspirationneed to be calculated online. Estimating the first two variables is more important yet tedious due topractical limitations of knowing the amount of water actually infiltrated into the soil. In order to solvethis problem, we propose to apply system identification on water balance data to obtain a linear timeseries model. We further investigate how to carry out the modelling (i) under saturated conditions, (ii)when there is a rule-based irrigation control, and (iii) under measurement noise in the soil moisturereadings. Using synthetic data we obtained a model fit above 80\% in all cases. Additionally, we showthe model optimality and applicability with an independent dataset, using residual tests. For two setsof field data, we observed model fits of 84\% and 63\%, and satisfaction in all residual tests. Simplicity inthe model reduces calibration efforts whereas its linearity and adequacy recommend it for real-timeirrigation control applications. In summary, the results indicate that a first order linear time series modelbased on system identification can successfully predict RZSMD in a real-time irrigation control system.},

  abstract = {The trend to speak of water productivity and ``crop per drop'' in plant\textendash{}water relationships, where before the 1990s the term water use efficiency was commonly used, has to be deplored. Whereas rain or irrigation water is always only one of the many inputs and growth conditions to ensure a certain output or yield, the term productivity is not appropriate and has to be reserved for genuine production factors such as labour, land and capital. Besides, expressing this water productivity in output per unit water input also is not always meaningful. Low values such as common in wetland rice cultivation, or in dryland farming in cycles including a fallow year may be very economic or wise forms of crop water management, whereas high values such as achieved in drip irrigation may be not. Where the concurrent opportunity costs or forgone values, e.g., the alternative potentials of the saved or lost water is not taken into account, high water productivity values may not be a suitable target. Irrigation efficiency and water use efficiency remain useful and meaningful parameters, provided they are well defined and used at the level of individual farmers or irrigation projects. For more holistic and agro-ecological perspectives, they are appropriate only if used as a `` value-free'' parameter in need of further evaluation against social, ecological, sustainable or other desiderata. Historical aspects of the differing concepts in plant\textendash{}water relationships and agricultural water management are extensively dealt with. It is shown that the 20th century concepts and definitions of crop water relationship parameters, so much needed in agricultural water management, hinge more on the economic and geographical conditions than on mere scientific notions. Field cases to illustrate and defend my conservative stances are provided. It is concluded that a split-up of domains is needed to properly define water use efficiency for different perspectives: a universal or single menu cannot be applicable due to the technical and socioeconomic diversity of issues and challenges.},

Sustainable intensification of agricultural techniques are therefore required, such as water management practices that result in higher agricultural production without causing severe environmental impacts, whilst at the same time improving resilience to drought and dry spells. Water harvesting practices have shown promising results in reducing risks, and improving yields whilst also delivering positive impacts on other ecosystems. However, before large scale implementation of water harvesting, further investigation of local downstream impacts are warranted. We conclude that water harvesting remains a promising option for sustainable agricultural intensification in the water scarce tropics, resulting in both risk reduction and yield improvements.},

The MarkSimGCM daily weather generator was used to generate projected rainfall and temperature data using the outputs from ECHAM5 general circulation model and ensemble mean of six models under A2 (high) and B1 (low) emission scenarios. Crop yield simulations were made with the FAO's AquaCrop model. The projected rainfall during Kiremt increases by 12\textendash{}69 \% while rainfall during Belg decreases by 20\textendash{}68 \%. The combined effect of elevated CO2 and projected climate factors increases maize yield by up to 59 \% in sub-humid/humid areas of the CRV, but could result in a decrease of up to 46 \% in the semiarid areas under ECHAM5 model. However, the maize yield increases in all parts of the CRV under the ensemble mean of models. Wheat yield shows no significant response to the projected rainfall changes, but increases by up to 40 \% due to elevated CO2. Our results generally suggest that climate change will increase crop yields in the sub-humid/humid regions of the CRV. However, in the semi-arid parts the overall projected climate change will affect crop yields negatively.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of climate change on winter and summer paddy yields and evaluates adaptation measures in order to overcome the projected impacts of climate change in Quang Nam province of Vietnam. Future climate-change scenarios for the periods of 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were projected by downscaling the outputs of HadCM3 general circulation model for the two selected IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the impact of future climate on paddy yield. The minimum and maximum temperatures of the basin are expected to increase by 0.35\textendash{}1.72 and 0.93\textendash{}3.69 \ensuremath{^\circ}C, respectively in future. Similarly, the annual precipitation is expected to increase by 9.75 \% in future. Results show that climate change will reduce paddy yield in winter season for both scenarios and all time periods, whereas an increase in the yield is expected in the summer season for 2020s and 2050s relative to baseline yield. The overall decrease in paddy yield in winter season can be offset, and paddy yield of summer season can be enhanced to potential level by altering the transplanting dates and by introducing supplementary irrigation. Late transplanting of paddy shows an increase in yield by 20\textendash{}27 \% in future, whereas supplementary irrigation in winter season paddy shows an increase in yield up to 42 \% in future. The results of this study can be used by policy makers and key stakeholders to optimize paddy production under changing climate regimes in Quang Nam province of Vietnam.},

  abstract = {CropSyst is a multi-year, multi-crop, daily time step cropping systems simulation model developed to serve as an analytical tool to study the effect of climate, soils, and management on cropping systems productivity and the environment. CropSyst simulates the soil water and nitrogen budgets, crop growth and development, crop yield, residue production and decomposition, soil erosion by water, and salinity. The development of CropSyst started in the early 1990s, evolving to a suite of programs including a cropping systems simulator (CropSyst), a weather generator (ClimGen), GIS-CropSyst cooperator program (ArcCS), a watershed model (CropSyst Watershed), and several miscellaneous utility programs. CropSyst and associated programs can be downloaded free of charge over the Internet. One key feature of CropSyst is the implementation of a generic crop simulator that enables the simulation of both yearly and multi-year crops and crop rotations via a single set of parameters. Simulations can last a fraction of a year to hundreds of years. The model has been evaluated in many world locations by comparing model estimates to data collected in field experiments. CropSyst has been applied to perform risk and economic analyses of scenarios involving different cropping systems, management options, and soil and climatic conditions. An extensive list of references related to model development, evaluation, and application is provided.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in Malawi and accounts for 40\% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 90\% of export revenues. Corn is the major cereal crop grown as a staple food under rainfed conditions, covers more than 92\% of the total agricultural area, and contributes 54\% of caloric intake. Corn production is the principle occupation and major source of income for more than 80\% of the total population in Malawi. Issues of hunger and food insecurity for the entire nation are associated with scarcity and low corn production. This study evaluates the impacts of climate change in mid-century on rainfed corn production in the Lilongwe District of Malawi. First, outputs of 15 GCMs under different emission scenarios are statistically downscaled. Probability assessment of bounded ranges with known distributions is used to account for the uncertainties of GCMs. AquaCrop is employed to assess potential rainfed corn production with and without climate change. Results show that by mid-century corn production in the Lilongwe District can decrease by as much as 14\% due to temperature increase and precipitation decrease by up to 2.20\ensuremath{^\circ}C and 26\%, respectively.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0378-3774(01)00096-8},
  abstract = {Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a common practice in the dry environments and aims at improving and stabilizing rainfed crops by adding small amounts of water to rainfed crops during times when rainfall fails to provide sufficient moisture for normal plant growth. Results from long-term research in experimental stations and farmer fields showed substantial increases in rainfed crop yields and water use efficiency in response to SI. Nevertheless, SI comes at a cost.

The date of sowing winter wheat in a rainfed Mediterranean-type environment depends upon the onset of rainfall. The optimal date for achieving highest yield under rainfed conditions is around mid-November. However, farmers tend to sow wheat later than this date because of the delay and/or unreliability of initial rains. With SI, early sowing and crop establishment can be ensured. However, early sowing of all the fields' results in higher water demand during a very short period in spring because all the fields will be at the peak use rate. Spreading out dates of sowing allows peak water demand to occur over a longer period, thus reducing the discharge and the size of irrigation system needed, and hence improves the economics of this practice. In this paper, the impact of adopting a multi-sowing date strategy on farm water demand and crop production is considered. A simplified optimization model solved by linear programming is presented. Four-years' data (1992\textendash{}1996) from field experimental research conducted on bread wheat in northern Syria have been used in the analysis.

We showed that a multi-sowing date strategy has reduced the peak farm water demand rate by more than 20\%, thus potentially reducing irrigation system capacity and/or size. Alternatively, the water demand rate of a larger area can be met with the same water supply. However, optimal sowing dates that minimize farm water demand rate do not always maximize total farm production. The outcome depends on crop water requirements and yield for each sowing date. Furthermore, this selection is greatly influenced by the level of water scarcity. The approach used can help in reducing the cost of irrigation and improving the efficiency of water use in SI.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The water driven crop growth model AquaCrop was evaluated for predicting the yield of kharif maize (i.e. maize sown in the monsoon season) under future water availability scenarios. Future climatic data were generated using the climate data generator ClimGen, which was parameterized using 37 years (1972\textendash{}2008) of historical data relating to the study area. The climatic data generated were used first in the CROPWAT model to estimate the irrigation schedule, which was then used in the validated AquaCrop model to predict grain yield for future years. Rainfall estimates generated by ClimGen for 2012 (739 mm) and 2014 (625 mm) resulted in yields of 1600 and 5670 kg/ha, respectively, under rainfed situation during these 2 years with full fertilization levels. This variation may be attributed to the depths of rainfall events and their distribution during the entire growing season in general and sensitive growth stages in particular pertaining to the same sowing date (22 July) in both years. Nonetheless, the use of ClimGen, CROPWAT and AquaCrop models can be standardized as a model-linking protocol to estimate future maize yield and irrigation water requirements for sustainable production and as an adaptation measure to climate change.},

We then review literature describing the responses of wheat plants to extreme temperatures. Cardinal temperature thresholds for different phenological processes in wheat are identified and we outline the effects of temperature on rates of growth and development. Finally, we assess the implications of the above for future climatic impact studies.

Our summary shows how relatively small and consistent are the standard errors of the cardinal mean temperatures for many of the processes examined. Cardinal temperatures are conservative between studies and are seemingly well-defined in wheat. Into this category we put the lethal limits for wheat, the sterility response at anthesis, the cardinal temperatures for vernalization and some of the base and optimal temperatures. Important questions for the future involve the effects of combinations of extreme events and the modelling of specific effects such as the influence of high temperatures on grain set.},

  abstract = {The AquaCrop model clarifies the effects of water on crop yield and is a useful tool for improving farm-level water management and optimizing water use efficiency. AquaCrop is a water-driven simulation model that requires a relatively low number of parameters and input data to simulate the yield response to water of most of the major field and vegetable crops cultivated worldwide. Although the model is simple, it pays particular attention to the fundamental processes involved in crop productivity and in the responses to water, from a physiological and agronomic perspective. Good agreement was obtained by AquaCrop in simulating wheat yields under full irrigation. The experiment was conducted with 10 varieties (DBW 17, RAJ 4120, PBW 621, K 0307, HD 2733, HD 2687, CBW 38, DBW 39, HD 2985 and PBW 343) of wheat during 20082009 and 20092010 at the farm of Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya at Majhian located in Dakshin Dinajpur District of West Bengal, India, during December to April, and growth stages and production were simulated using the AquaCrop model for the best variety. The model simulated wheat yield as 4.16tha1as compared to the actual yield of 4.10tha1 in the year 20082009. The model was validated in 20092010 for simulating wheat yield and performance of the model was quite satisfactory. The model simulated 4.01tha1 as compared to the actual yield of 3.90tha1. The model did not perform very well for the validation period. The simplicity of AquaCrop in its required minimum input data, which are readily available or can easily be collected, makes it user-friendly. It is also a very useful model for scenario simulations and for planning purposes to be used by economists, water administrators and managers working in West Bengal, India.

  doi = {10.2134/agronj14.0287},
  abstract = {Crop production in the Caribbean is dominated by small open field holdings that are almost totally reliant on rainfall. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam. [Convolvulaceae]) has been identified as an important commodity to attain food and nutrition security goals of the region, particularly in light of a changing climate. The crop has high nutritional value, innate drought-tolerant properties, and can be grown with relatively low inputs. The routine use of crop models for yield optimization is largely absent in the Caribbean. In this study, an attempt was made to parameterize the FAO AquaCrop model for sweet potato for the first time. AquaCrop is a simulation model for crop water productivity, designed primarily for use in irrigation management. Parameters were developed using data from three sweet potato cultivars grown in two agroecological zones in Jamaica under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Digital photography was combined with an automated canopy estimator to track canopy development, and sample harvesting was done throughout the crop season. The overall simulation of biomass was good, with deviations of \ensuremath{<}28\% for four out of six simulations, and season-long performance of the model was commendable. The simulation of yield presented more challenges, especially given the nonlinear rate of tuber development. The results, however, indicate that AquaCrop could be a useful tool for Caribbean agriculture in predicting the productivity of sweet potato under varying water availability.},

  issn = {14747065},
  doi = {10.1016/j.pce.2015.09.005},
  abstract = {Globally, various climatic studies have estimated a reduction of crop yields due to changes in surface
temperature and precipitation especially for the developing countries which is heavily dependent on
agriculture and lacks resources to counter the negative effects of climate change. Uganda's economy and
the wellbeing of its populace depend on rain-fed agriculture which is susceptible to climate change. This
study quantified the impacts of climate change and variability in Uganda and how coping strategies can
enhance crop production against climate change and/or variability.
The study used statistical methods to establish various climate change and variability indicators across
the country, and uses the FAO AquaCrop model to simulate yields under possible future climate scenarios
with and without adaptation strategies. Maize, the most widely grown crop was used for the study.
Meteorological, soil and crop data were collected for various districts representing the maize growing
ecological zones in the country.
Based on this study, it was found that temperatures have increased by up to 1 C across much of
Uganda since the 1970s, with rates of warming around 0.3 C per decade across the country. High
altitude, low rainfall regions experience the highest level of warming, with over 0.5 C/decade recorded
in Kasese. Rainfall is variable and does not follow a specific significant increasing or decreasing trend. For
both future climate scenarios, Maize yields will reduce in excess of 4.7\% for the fast warming-low rainfall
climates but increase on average by 3.5\% for slow warming-high rainfall regions, by 2050. Improved soil
fertility can improve yields by over 50\% while mulching and use of surface water management practices
improve yields by single digit percentages. The use of fertilizer application needs to go hand in hand with
other water management strategies since more yields as a result of the improved soil fertility leads to
increased water stress, especially for the dry climates.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0378-3774(03)00008-8},
  abstract = {Unreliable and erratic rainfall combined with inherent low soil fertility in crust prone soils affect crop growth in the Sahel. Past efforts of agricultural water management have primarily focused on maximising rainfall infiltration through soil and water conservation. The challenge of how to cope with dry-spells, short periods of water stress during crop growth, remains largely unsolved. Small-scale water harvesting (WH) for supplemental irrigation may be a tool for small-holder farmers to stabilise crop water supply and thereby increase yields and create incentives for increased investments in fertilisation. Results are presented on the effects on Sorghum (Sorghum Bicolor (L.)) yields under supplemental irrigation and soil nutrient application in an on-farm experiment in northern Burkina Faso. Focus is on dry-spell bridging and water and nutrient interactions on biomass productivity. The water harvesting system consisted of a low-cost manually dug farm pond with a storage volume of 150 m3, collecting surface runoff as rill and small gully flow from a 1.8 ha catchment area. The on-farm experiment involved five repetitions of two levels of nutrient application (non-fertilised and fertilised) and two levels of supplemental irrigation (non-irrigated and irrigated) including: farmers' traditional practices (TC), supplemental irrigation (I), fertiliser application (F) and supplemental irrigation combined with fertilisation (IF). This paper presents field results from three rainy seasons (1998\textendash{}2000), receiving a cumulative seasonal rainfall ranging from 418 to 667 mm. Supplemental irrigation ranging from 60 to 90 mm per season was applied based on actual occurrence of dry-spell induced crop water stress. Supplemental irrigation had a significant effect on grain yield over the three crop seasons (\ensuremath{{_\ast}{_\ast}}P\&lt;0.001). Similarly, fertiliser application (46.5 kg N ha-1) resulted in a significantly higher grain yield (\ensuremath{{_\ast}{_\ast}{_\ast}}P\&lt;0.0001). Analysis of variance for interactions between supplemental irrigation and fertiliser application showed significant differences between treatments when analysing the 3 years together (\ensuremath{{_\ast}{_\ast}{_\ast}}P\&lt;0.0001). The control grain yield's (TC) average over the 3 years was 455 kg ha-1. Supplemental irrigation alone resulted in an average grain yield of 712 kg ha-1, while fertiliser application alone gave an average grain yield of 975 kg ha-1. Supplemental irrigation combined with fertiliser application resulted in an average grain yield of 1403 kg ha-1, which is higher than the farmer's normal practice by a factor of three. Total above ground biomass yields followed the same pattern as the grain yields for respective years. All three seasons provided data systematically supporting supplemental irrigation as a dry-spell mitigating and yield gap reducing technology.},

  abstract = {Globally, agriculture accounts for 80\textendash{}90\% of all freshwater used by humans, and most of that is in crop production. In many areas, this water use is unsustainable; water supplies are also under pressure from other users and are being affected by climate change. Much effort is being made to reduce water use by crops and produce `more crop per drop'. This paper examines water use by crops, taking particularly a physiological viewpoint, examining the underlying relationships between carbon uptake, growth and water loss. Key examples of recent progress in both assessing and improving crop water productivity are described. It is clear that improvements in both agronomic and physiological understanding have led to recent increases in water productivity in some crops. We believe that there is substantial potential for further improvements owing to the progress in understanding the physiological responses of plants to water supply, and there is considerable promise within the latest molecular genetic approaches, if linked to the appropriate environmental physiology. We conclude that the interactions between plant and environment require a team approach looking across the disciplines from genes to plants to crops in their particular environments to deliver improved water productivity and contribute to sustainability.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The water driven crop growth model AquaCrop was evaluated for predicting the yield of kharif maize (i.e. maize sown in the monsoon season) under future water availability scenarios. Future climatic data were generated using the climate data generator ClimGen, which was parameterized using 37 years (1972\textendash{}2008) of historical data relating to the study area. The climatic data generated were used first in the CROPWAT model to estimate the irrigation schedule, which was then used in the validated AquaCrop model to predict grain yield for future years. Rainfall estimates generated by ClimGen for 2012 (739 mm) and 2014 (625 mm) resulted in yields of 1600 and 5670 kg/ha, respectively, under rainfed situation during these 2 years with full fertilization levels. This variation may be attributed to the depths of rainfall events and their distribution during the entire growing season in general and sensitive growth stages in particular pertaining to the same sowing date (22 July) in both years. Nonetheless, the use of ClimGen, CROPWAT and AquaCrop models can be standardized as a model-linking protocol to estimate future maize yield and irrigation water requirements for sustainable production and as an adaptation measure to climate change.},

While a model with pre-fixed ``one-size-fits-all'' model structure is traditionally used in lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling, this paper shows the advantages of model structure inference from data or field evidence in a case-specific and step-wise way using non-commensurable measures derived from observed series. The step-wise model structure identification method does not lead to higher accuracy than the traditional approach when evaluated using common statistical criteria like the Nash\textendash{}Sutcliffe efficiency. The method is, however, favorable to produce a well-balanced calibration obtaining accurate results for a wide range of runoff properties: total flows, quick and slow subflows, cumulative volumes, peak flows, low flows, frequency distributions of peak and low flows, changes in quick flows for given changes in rainfall. It furthermore is shown that model performance evaluation procedures that account for the flow residual serial dependency and homoscedasticity are preferred. Explicit evaluation of model results for peak and/or low flow extremes and changes in these extremes make the models useful for impact investigations on such hydrological extremes.},

  title = {Applications of crop/soil simulation models in tropical agricultural systems},
  volume = {Volume 76},
  abstract = {Crop simulation models have been used widely to describe systems and processes at the level of the genotype, the crop, the farming system, the region, and the global environment, but examples of how the use of such models has benefited poor people in developing countries are limited. There is, therefore, an urgent need to make the use of models in research more relevant to problems in the real world and to find effective means of disseminating the results from work using models to the potential beneficiaries.

To achieve this, we believe that there must be a shift in the thinking of crop/soil modelers toward making people more center stage and toward a more problem-solving approach. This means researchers must think of the real problems faced by ordinary people in developing countries and construct and apply their models to contribute to solving these problems. For this to be effective, modelers need to define clearly who are the end users of their models and to enter into dialogue with these people so that the final product is tailored to their needs.

There appear to be two opposite directions in which further crop modeling research can develop. On the one hand, in response to the rapidly expanding field of genomics, links between information at the gene level and performance at the phenotype level need to be established, and methodologies to do this must be developed. Such models will have the potential to contribute to enhancing the efficiency of crop improvement programs worldwide by providing more efficient ways of identifying and evaluating desirable characteristics for specific plant breeding goals. On the other hand, crop models need to be incorporated into higher order systems such as the whole farm, catchment, or region. Some progress has already been made in linking crop growth models with other physical process models to improve our understanding of how changes in agricultural systems influence overall environmental impacts. However, the role of people in these systems also needs to be made explicit so that the day-to-day decisions that they make to sustain and improve their livelihoods and the influence these decisions have on their environment and natural resource base can be taken into account.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11027-014-9567-2},
  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of climate change on winter and summer rice (Oryza sativa) yield and evaluates several adaptation measures to overcome the negative impact of climate change on rice production in the Quang Nam province of Vietnam. Future climate change scenarios for time periods in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were projected by downscaling the outputs of the General Circulation Model (GCM), Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3) A2 and B2 scenarios. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the impact of future climates on rice yield. The minimum and maximum temperature of the province is projected to increase by 0.35\textendash{}1.72 \ensuremath{^\circ}C and 0.93\textendash{}3.69 \ensuremath{^\circ}C respectively in future. Similarly, the annual precipitation is expected to increase by 9.75 \% in the 2080s. Results show that climate change will reduce rice yield from 1.29 to 23.05 \% during the winter season for both scenarios and all time periods, whereas an increase in yield by 2.07 to 6.66 \% is expected in the summer season for the 2020s and 2050s; relative to baseline yield. The overall decrease of rice yield in the winter season can be offset, and rice yield in the summer season can be enhanced to potential levels by altering the transplanting dates and by introducing supplementary irrigation. Late transplanting of rice shows an increase of yield by 20\textendash{}27 \% in future. Whereas supplementary irrigation of rice in the winter season shows an increase in yield of up to 42 \% in future. Increasing the fertilizer application rate enhances the yield from 0.3 to 29.8 \% under future climates. Similarly, changing the number of doses of fertilizer application increased rice yield by 1.8 to 5.1 \%, relative to the current practice of single dose application. Shifting to other heat tolerant varieties also increased the rice production. Based on the findings, changing planting dates, supplementary irrigation, proper nutrient management and adopting to new rice cultivars can be beneficial for the adaptation of rice cultivation under climate change scenarios in central Vietnam.},

  abstract = {Water use efficiency ( w ) is a crop parameter of outstanding importance in crop simulation models, derived here as the slope of the relationship linking crop carbon gain to cumulative transpiration. This study aims at: (i) evaluating w of field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea, at three levels of aggregation\textemdash{}day-time net assimilation (A), daily net carbon gain, as difference between A and night-time dark respiration (R), and biomass; (ii) assessing the robustness of w parameter in terms of ability to discriminate between C3 and C4 species, pre- and post-anthesis, impact of nitrogen status; (iii) investigating the opportunity to normalize w by climate, using FAO-Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (Eref) or atmospheric saturation vapour pressure deficit (D); (iv) comparing w with the corresponding radiation use efficiency (\ensuremath{\varepsilon}) results presented in the companion paper. Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999 in southern Italy. All crops were well watered. Sunflower and sorghum had two nitrogen application treatments: wheat had only one and chickpea had no added nitrogen. Closed-system canopy chambers, automated for continuous measurements, were used to monitor gas-exchanges at the canopy scale, in terms of both carbon exchange rate (CER) and evapotranspiration E, and the cuvette method to monitor gas-exchange at the leaf scale. w , expressed in terms of A, A - R, or above-ground biomass, was linear over the entire cycle of sorghum and wheat, and up to anthesis in sunflower and chickpea, independent of temperature, vapour pressure deficit and radiation regimes. In sunflower, deviation from linearity was observed after anthesis due to higher carbon cost in yielding oil seeds. No conclusions could be drawn for post-anthesis chickpea due to the destruction of the crop by a thunderstorm. The overall response patterns were common to w and \ensuremath{\varepsilon}. Nevertheless, w proved to be more robust than \ensuremath{\varepsilon} due to its high capacity to discriminate between species groups (C3 from C4) and its effectiveness in normalizing the values for climate, provided it is implemented through Eref rather than D. All the above confers larger extrapolative ability to w -based crop models.},

  abstract = {Increasing crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in dryland farming requires a quantitative understanding of relationships between crop yield and the water balance over many years. Here, we report on a long-term dryland monitoring site at the Loess Plateau, Shanxi, China, where winter wheat was grown for 30 consecutive years and soil water content (0\textendash{}200 cm) was measured every 10 days. The monitoring data were used to calibrate the AquaCrop model and then to analyse the components of the water balance. There was a strong positive relationship between total available water and mean cereal yield. However, only one-third of the available water was actually used by the winter wheat for crop transpiration. The remaining two-thirds were lost by soil evaporation, of which 40 and 60\% was lost during the growing and fallow seasons, respectively. Wheat yields ranged from 0.6 to 3.9 ton/ha and WUE from 0.3 to 0.9 kg/m3. Results of model experiments suggest that minimizing soil evaporation via straw mulch or plastic film covers could potentially double wheat yields and WUE. We conclude that the relatively low wheat yields and low WUE were mainly related to (i) limited rainfall, (ii) low soil water storage during fallow season due to large soil evaporation, and (iii) poor synchronisation of the wheat growing season to the rain season. The model experiments suggest significant potential for increased yields and WUE.},

However, policy interpretations may be limited as most existing models do not explicitly consider two important aspects of observed irrigation decision making, namely the limits on instantaneous irrigation rates imposed by well yield and the intraseasonal structure of irrigation planning. We develop a new modeling approach for determining irrigation demand that is based on observed farmer behavior and captures the impacts on production and water use of both well yield and climate. Through a case study of irrigated corn production in the Texas High Plains region of the United States we predict optimal irrigation strategies under variable levels of groundwater supply, and assess the limits of existing models for predicting land and groundwater use decisions by farmers. Our results show that irrigation behavior exhibits complex nonlinear responses to changes in groundwater availability. Declining well yields induce large reductions in the optimal size of irrigated area and irrigation use as constraints on instantaneous application rates limit the ability to maintain sufficient soil moisture to avoid negative impacts on crop yield. We demonstrate that this important behavioral response to limited groundwater availability is not captured by existing modeling approaches, which therefore may be unreliable predictors of irrigation demand, agricultural profitability, and resilience to climate change and aquifer depletion.},

The multiple criteria or objectives are based on multiple and non-commensurable measures of information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the river flow series in subflows, split of the series in nearly independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of nearly independent peak and low flows. The protocol accounts for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals, significantly advanced through the use of nearly independent flow values extracted from the flow series. Next to the separate evaluation of the subflow recessions, the quick and slow runoff peak and low values and event volumes, also the performance of the model in predicting extreme high and low flow statistics is validated. To support the time series processing tasks as well as the application of the multi-criteria model evaluation protocol, a Microsoft Excel-based tool (WETSPRO: Water Engineering Time Series PROcessing tool) has been developed. It is based on the assessment of graphical displays, which complement traditional goodness-of-fit statistics.},

While its theoretical underpinning has been questioned it remains a powerful hydrological tool in the absence of detailed data and is therefore used extensively in hydrological models. This study aims to characterize the variation in maximum retention values (S), which underlie curve numbers, for a range of agricultural treatments across a large spatial area in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The data used for the analysis spans several decades of rainfall runoff observations. A range of different derivation methods result in variation in mean and variance of S. In particular, methods that emphasize the larger storms result in greater S and thus lower runoff. For larger spatial scales, emphasis on larger storms gives more reliable estimates of S. Systematic variation in S arises from variations in treatment, pre-runoff soil moisture, rainfall depth, and variations in cover. On the basis of the analysis, a table of curve number values for different land uses found in NSW is presented. The resulting distributions of S and curve numbers provide guidance for rainfall runoff modelling studies in the agricultural important areas of NSW.

  volume = {130},
  issn = {0378-3774},
  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2013.08.005},
  abstract = {The FAO AquaCrop model has been conceived as a tool for simulating, on a daily scale, the canopy cover (CC), biomass and the actual evapotranspiration and for simulating, on a seasonal scale, the final biomass, the harvested yield, the cumulate actual evapotranspiration, and the crop water use efficiency. This performance was analysed after a series of tests carried on 12 crop cycles, concerning corn and tomato grown in the Mediterranean region, and having three levels of plant water stress: absence of plant water stress (control), moderately stressed and severely stressed. The results highlight the effects of three factors affecting the AquaCrop performances: the species, the level of plant water stress during the crop cycle and the output variable to simulate.
The AquaCrop adequately simulates the daily canopy cover (CC) in control treatments of tomato and corn, and in moderate stress treatment of corn. In the severe stressed treatment of corn, the simulated values of CC were close to the measured values only from sowing to 60 days after sowing, after that the simulated values do not fit the measurements.
The AquaCrop model adequately simulates the daily biomass accumulation under all treatments in tomato and under non-stressed and moderate stressed treatments in corn. However, the simulated biomass outputs were generally overestimated during the late stages of the crop cycles and, consequently, the yield also exhibited a tendency to be overestimated. Nevertheless, the yield overestimation can be retained as acceptable because the normalised differences (D) between the simulations and measured values were less than 15\% on average. An exception was the tomato yield simulated in the severely stressed treatment, for which D was greater than 30\%. In contrast, in the case of the severely stressed treatment in corn, AquaCrop did not exhibit any aptitude for simulating the biomass or the grain yield. In fact, the model predicts the absence of any yield production, while 5 t ha-1 of grain were actually measured in the severely stressed treatment.
The daily actual evapotranspiration simulated by AquaCrop was consistent with the observations only in the case of the control treatments of tomato, in all the three seasons. In contrast, for the other treatments (all treatments in corn and all stressed treatments in tomato), the quality of the evapotranspiration simulation was poor.
In general, AquaCrop underestimated the seasonal values of evapotranspiration. The normalised differences between the seasonal values of the observations and simulations are acceptable in the case of the tomato evapotranspiration (D = -7\%). However, in the case of corn, the differences are related to the level of plant water stress, and they become unacceptable (D = -36\%) in the severely stressed treatments.
The overestimation of the yield and the underestimation of the seasonal evapotranspiration cause the simulations of the water use efficiency to be overestimated. In the specific case of corn, due to the unacceptable performance of the model under severely stressed treatments, the linear regression between the observations and measurements of water use efficiency is unsatisfactory.
The potential uses of the AquaCrop model as a tool for research purposes aimed to enhance the water efficiency and as a tool for managing irrigation have been deeply discussed. The paths that should be followed in the future to improve the model simulations have also been suggested},

The crop simulation model AquaCrop, recently developed by FAO can be used for a wide range of purposes. However, in its present form, its use over large areas or for applications that require a large number of simulations runs (e.g., long-term analysis), is not practical without developing software to facilitate such applications. Two tools for managing the inputs and outputs of AquaCrop, named AquaData and AquaGIS, have been developed for this purpose and are presented here. Both software utilities have been programmed in Delphi v. 5 and in addition, AquaGIS requires the Geographic Information System (GIS) programming tool MapObjects. These utilities allow the efficient management of input and output files, along with a GIS module to develop spatial analysis and effect spatial visualization of the results, facilitating knowledge dissemination. A sample of application of the utilities is given here, as an AquaCrop simulation analysis of impact of climate change on wheat yield in Southern Spain, which requires extensive input data preparation and output processing. The use of AquaCrop without the two utilities would have required approximately 1000 h of work, while the utilization of AquaData and AquaGIS reduced that time by more than 99\%. Furthermore, the use of GIS, made it possible to perform a spatial analysis of the results, thus providing a new option to extend the use of the AquaCrop model to scales requiring spatial and temporal analyses.},

  abstract = {An investigation was carried out to assess the climate change impacts on rainfed maize yield using AquaCrop and CERES\textendash{}maize crop simulation models, and evaluation of adaptation measures were performed for Sikkim state of India. Data related to crop phenology retrieved from the field experiments were used to calibrate and validate the crop models for three representative sites. Climate projections of six global circulation models (ECHAM5, CCSM, HadCM3, CSIRO-MK3.0, CGCM3.1, and MIROC3.2) for scenarios A2 and B2 were bias-corrected at station scale by power law transformation. Simulation results by the two crop models indicate a significant declination in the yield of NLD-White variety of maize ranging from 4.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.4 to 20.4 \ensuremath{\pm} 7.2 \% for the future time windows under A2 scenario and 2.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.9 to 15.8 \ensuremath{\pm} 5.7 \% under B2 scenario relative to the yield simulated for the baseline period of 1991\textendash{}2000. It is also observed that, for a particular temperature, yield remarkably increases with escalated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. On contrary, increase in temperature reduces the yield at a particular CO2 concentration. The overall decline in the yield under future climate scenarios can be alleviated by early planting, appropriate nutrient management, introducing supplementary irrigation, and shifting to heat-tolerant varieties.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of climate change on winter and summer paddy yields and evaluates adaptation measures in order to overcome the projected impacts of climate change in Quang Nam province of Vietnam. Future climate-change scenarios for the periods of 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were projected by downscaling the outputs of HadCM3 general circulation model for the two selected IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the impact of future climate on paddy yield. The minimum and maximum temperatures of the basin are expected to increase by 0.35\textendash{}1.72 and 0.93\textendash{}3.69 \ensuremath{^\circ}C, respectively in future. Similarly, the annual precipitation is expected to increase by 9.75 \% in future. Results show that climate change will reduce paddy yield in winter season for both scenarios and all time periods, whereas an increase in the yield is expected in the summer season for 2020s and 2050s relative to baseline yield. The overall decrease in paddy yield in winter season can be offset, and paddy yield of summer season can be enhanced to potential level by altering the transplanting dates and by introducing supplementary irrigation. Late transplanting of paddy shows an increase in yield by 20\textendash{}27 \% in future, whereas supplementary irrigation in winter season paddy shows an increase in yield up to 42 \% in future. The results of this study can be used by policy makers and key stakeholders to optimize paddy production under changing climate regimes in Quang Nam province of Vietnam.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an innovative method\textemdash{}that combines a technical and socio-economic analysis\textemdash{}is presented to assess the implications of policy decisions on water productivity. In the technical part, the variability in crop water productivity (CWP) is analyzed on the basis of actual water consumption and associated biomass production using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). This generates input for the socio-economic analysis, which aims to quantify the foregone economic water productivity (EWP) of policy decisions to allocate water in a social optimal way. The basis for arguments to transfer water between categories of users will be strengthened and be more objective when the productivity in existing and alternative uses is known. The usefulness of such an approach is shown in the South African part of the Inkomati Basin, where according to the Water Act, water has to be reserved for basic human needs and to protect aquatic ecosystems. The opportunity costs, in terms of foregone EWP, of decisions to divert water away from agriculture are assessed. The results show that diverting water away from crops with a low CWP is not always the most cost-effective way in terms of foregone EWP.},

  abstract = {Zimbabwe's poor are predominantly located in the semi-arid regions and rely on rainfed agriculture for their subsistence. Decline in productivity, scarcity of arable land, irrigation expansion limitations, erratic rainfall and frequent dry spells, among others cause food scarcity. The challenge faced by small-scale farmers is to enhance water productivity of rainfed agriculture by mitigating intra-seasonal dry spells (ISDS) through the adoption of new technologies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). The paper analyses the agro-hydrological functions of RWH and assesses its impacts (at field scale) on the crop yield gap as well as the Transpirational Water Productivity (WPT). The survey in six districts of the semi-arid Zimbabwe suggests that three parameters (water source, primary use and storage capacity) can help differentiate storage-type-RWH systems from ``conventional dams''. The Agricultural Production Simulator Model (APSIM) was used to simulate seven different treatments (Control, RWH, Manure, Manure + RWH, Inorganic Nitrogen and Inorganic Nitrogen + RWH) for 30 years on alfisol deep sand, assuming no fertiliser carry over effect from season to season. The combined use of inorganic fertiliser and RWH is the only treatment that closes the yield gap. Supplemental irrigation alone not only reduces the risks of complete crop failure (from 20\% down to 7\% on average) for all the treatments but also enhances WPT (from 1.75 kg m-3 up to 2.3 kg m-3 on average) by mitigating ISDS.},

  abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the potential effects of the climatic variations on the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and, consequently, on the crop water requirements in the Apulian Tavoliere, one of the largest irrigated districts of Southern Italy. To reach this purpose, both climatic parameters (air temperature and rainfall) and estimated water requirements of `processing' tomato (among the most representative irrigated crops in the district since the mid-1970s and, therefore, chosen as a study-case) were analyzed in order to find out if a time trend exists or does not. The analysis covered the period from 1957 to 2008. The analysis showed that the rainfall amounts decreased (-3.4 mm per year in the analyzed period), while air temperature increased (0.18 \ensuremath{^\circ}C and 0.25-\ensuremath{^\circ}C per decade for minimum and maximum, respectively). As a consequence of the climatic variation during the considered period, a growth trend of the ET0 (1.4 mm per year) and water deficit (3.2 mm per year) took place. As a consequence, the water amounts for irrigating the same crop in the considered period were growing. This increased consumption is in agreement with the perception of the farmers of the district but never documented. Through the FAO AquaCrop model, the tomato irrigation water requirements have been simulated during the considered period. The trend analysis of the seasonal evapotranspiration values simulated in 52 years confirmed the increase in tomato water requirements (0.7 mm per year).},

  abstract = {Crops For the Future Research Centre (CFFRC) is currently developing CropBASE\textemdash{}a cross-cutting web-based platform for decision support and knowledge sharing on underutilised crops and their end uses. It provides a quantitative basis to compare underutilised crop productivity and resource-use-efficiency with that of major crops and cropping systems under current and future climate scenarios, and will include interactive tools to integrate underutilised crop data with geo-referenced information in existing and new databases. Specific crop application models form the analysis engine of CropBASE, including crop-climate, crop-quality, crop-economic models to assess agroecological suitability, nutritional value, livelihood or food security potential of underutilised crops and products at field, farm and regional scales. A geospatial information system framework will link currently available climate databases as input data for crop models. CFFRC, already using major models for a range of crops around the world under the AgMIP program, will spearhead the inclusion of specific underutilised crops into recognised crop models. After briefly introducing CropBASE, this paper presents use cases as examples comparing yield and water productivity predictions for bambara groundnut (an underutilised African legume) and pearl millet (an alternative major cereal) under current and future climate scenarios in contrasting sub-Saharan African locations.},

The potential for increased irrigation is limited, so that future population increases will need to be fed from higher food production per unit land area and without the aid of increased irrigation resources. Thus, for improved food production, rainfall and irrigation water will be used more efficiently and the importance of understanding and managing crop water deficits is a necessity. Clearly, improving the drought resistance of our food and fiber crops is of strategic importance and progress should be sustained. Although the new technologies of genetic engineering hold considerable promise, they will need to be coupled to traditional breeding and agronomy if these new technologies are to be fully utilized. In this chapter, the development of ideas and methodologies that have emerged during the past decade are reviewed and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Application of crop residues to soil and reduced or no tillage are current management practices in order to achieve better water management, increase soil fertility, crop production and soil erosion control. This study was carried out to quantify the effect of wheat straw mulching in a no tilled Fluvisol under semi-arid conditions in SW Spain and to determine the optimum rate in terms of cost and soil protection. After a 3-years experiment, mulching application significantly improved physical and chemical properties of the studied soil with respect to control, and the intensity of changes was related to mulching rate. The organic matter content was generally increased, although no benefit was found beyond 10 Mg ha-1 year-1. Bulk density, porosity and aggregate stability were also improved with increasing mulching rates, which confirmed the interactions of these properties. Low mulching rates did not have a significant effect on water properties with respect to control, although the available water capacity increased greatly under high mulching rates. After simulated rainfall experiments (65 mm h-1 intensity), it was found that the mulch layer contributed to increase the roughness and the interception of raindrops, delaying runoff generation and enhancing the infiltration of rain water during storms. Mulching contributed to a reduction in runoff generation and soil losses compared to bare soil, and negligible runoff flow or sediment yield were determined under just 5 Mg ha-1 year-1 mulching rate. It was observed that during simulations, the erosive response quickly decreases with time after prolonged storms (30 min) due to the exhaustion of available erodible particles. These results suggest that the erosive consequences of intermediate intensity 5-years-recurrent storms in the studied area could be strongly diminished by using just 5 Mg ha-1 year-1 mulching rates.},

  abstract = {Weather has a significant impact on crop growth and development. This paper presents an overview of crop modeling and applications of crop models, and the significance of weather related to these applications. To account for the impact of weather and climate variability on crop production, agrometeorological variables are one of the key inputs required for the operation of crop simulation models. These include maximum and minimum air temperature, total solar radiation, and total rainfall. Most models use daily data as input, because variables at a smaller time scale are usually unavailable for most locations. It is important to define standard file formats for weather and other input data; this will expand the applicability of weather data by different models. Issues related to missing variables and data, as well as locations for which no data are available, need to be addressed for model applications, as it can affect the accuracy of the simulations. Weather generators can be used to stochastically generate daily data when data are missing or long-term historical data are unavailable. However, the use of observed weather data for model input will provide more precise crop yield simulations, especially for tropical regions. Many of the crop models have been applied towards strategic and tactical management decision making as well as yield forecasting. The predicted variability of crop yield and related variables as well as natural resource use is mainly due to the short- and long-term variation of weather and climate conditions. The results produced by the models can be used to make appropriate management decisions and to provide farmers and others with alternative options for their farming system. The crop models have been used extensively to study the impact of climate change on agricultural production and food security. Recently, they have also been applied towards the impact of climate variability and the effect of El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on agricultural production and food security. It is expected that, with the increased availability of computers, the use of crop models by farmers and consultants as well as policy and decision makers will increase. Weather data in the form of historical data or observations made during the current growing season, and short-, medium-, and long-term weather forecasts will play a critical role in these applications.},

  abstract = {Scarcity of water resources and growing competition for water in many sectors reduce its availability for irrigation. Effective management of water for crop production in water scarce areas requires efficient approaches. Increasing crop water productivity (WP) and drought tolerance by genetic improvement and physiological regulation may be the means to achieve efficient and effective use of water. But only high water productivity values carry little or no interest if they are not associated with high or acceptable yields. Such association of high (or moderate) productivity values with high (or moderate) yields has important implications on the effective use of water. In this paper we discussed the factors affecting water productivity, and the possible techniques to improve water productivity. A single approach would not be able to tackle the forthcoming challenge of producing more food and fiber with limited or even reduced available water. Combining biological water-saving measures with engineering solutions (water saving irrigation method, deficit irrigation, proper deficit sequencing, modernization of irrigation system, etc.), and agronomic and soil manipulation (seed priming, seedling age manipulation, direct- or wet-seeded rice, proper crop choice, integrating agriculture and aquaculture, increasing soil fertility, addition of organic matter, tillage and soil mulching, etc.) may solve the problem to a certain extent. New scientific information is needed to improve the economic gains of WP because the future improvements in WP seem to be limited by economic rather than a lack of technological means.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological\textendash{}economic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socio-economic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socio-economic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5\ensuremath{'}\texttimes{}5\ensuremath{'} latitude/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socio-economic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socio-economic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change.},

  abstract = {The BIOMASS methodology was developed with the objective of constructing defensible assessment biospheres for assessing potential radiological impacts of radioactive waste repositories. To this end, a set of Example Reference Biospheres were developed to demonstrate the use of the methodology and to provide an international point of reference.

In this paper, the performance of the Example Reference Biosphere model ERB 2B associated with the natural release scenario, discharge of contaminated groundwater to the surface environment, was evaluated by comparing its long-term projections of radionuclide dynamics and distribution in a soil-plant system to those of a process-based, transient advection-dispersion model (AD). The models were parametrised with data characteristic of a typical rainfed winter wheat crop grown on a sandy loam soil under temperate climate conditions. Three safety-relevant radionuclides, 99Tc, 129I and 237Np with different degree of sorption were selected for the study.

Although the models were driven by the same hydraulic (soil moisture content and water fluxes) and radiological (Kds) input data, their projections were remarkably different. On one hand, both models were able to capture short and long-term variation in activity concentration in the subsoil compartment. On the other hand, the Reference Biosphere model did not project any radionuclide accumulation in the topsoil and crop compartments. This behaviour would underestimate the radiological exposure under natural release scenarios.

The results highlight the potential role deep roots play in soil-to-plant transfer under a natural release scenario where radionuclides are released into the subsoil. When considering the relative activity and root depth profiles within the soil column, much of the radioactivity was taken up into the crop from the subsoil compartment.

Further improvements were suggested to address the limitations of the Reference Biosphere model presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET o ) is an essential component of irrigation water management due to it being a basic input for estimating crop water requirements. Multiple approaches have been identified for ET o assessment but most of them are based on daily meteorological data provided by weather station networks that provide an accurate meteorological characterization. A new alternative approach called MA+LSE based on the Makkink-Advection (MAK-Adv) equation in combination with remotely sensed solar radiation and a numerical weather forecast of near surface air temperature has provided good estimates of ET o under different weather conditions in a semi-arid region located in Southern Spain, without requiring local meteorological data. In order to evaluate the utility of the MA+LSE approach for irrigation water management, some well-known methods for ET o assessment and the MA+LSE approach were considered for the development of irrigation schedules in ten irrigation schemes located in a semi-arid region in Southern Spain. The impact of the approach considered for ET o assessment on irrigation scheduling and on simulated yield for a maize crop was determined. Thus, MA+LSE and Hargreaves methods generated similar irrigation schedules and estimated yield to those determined by using ET o from the Penman-Monteith (PM-FAO56) approach. Thus, average seasonal irrigation volume estimated by MA+LSE was underestimated by around 2.6\%, causing a yield reduction of 2.2\% compared with the irrigation scheduling based on PM-FAO56. These results confirm the applicability of the MA+LSE approach, especially in areas where meteorological data are missing or inaccurate, obtaining a similar performance for irrigation water management to that of other approaches with high data requirements such as PM-FAO56. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  shorttitle = {Developing scenarios to assess sunflower and soybean yield under different sowing dates and water regimes in the {{Bekaa}} valley ({{Lebanon}})},
  abstract = {In a semi-arid environment, the main challenge for crop production is water limitation in space and in time. Considered as appropriate tools, models are used to evaluate the effects of water deficit on crop productivity for better irrigation planning and sustainable yield. The AquaCrop model was tested using data collected during a 4-year experiment on soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon. The model was found to accurately simulate final crop biomass, yield and cumulative evapotranspiration: in fact the Wilmot index of agreement (IoA) values were 0.97, 0.96 and 0.96, respectively, for soybean and 0.93, 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, for sunflower, while the relative RMSE was 0.04, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively, for soybean and 0.04, 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, for sunflower. The analysis of irrigation scenarios showed that the early planting of sunflower could demonstrate a greater efficiency than late sowing. In addition, applying three irrigations, of 100 mm each, prior to flowering, at mid flowering stage and at the beginning of seed formation could lead to highest yields (ranging between 4.51 and 2.34 t ha(-1)) and crop water productivity (CWP) (ranging between 1.5 and 0.78 kg m(-3)). Sunflower yields were low (0.42 t ha(-1) to 0.37 t ha())(-1) and unreliable when one single irrigation was performed only at the beginning of seed formation, while highest values (ranging between 1.97 and 1.74 t ha(-1)) were obtained when it was done prior to flowering. The highest yields and crop water productivity for soybean were obtained when the crop was sown in April and by applying three irrigations, of 100 mm each, at full bloom, at seed enlargement and at mature seeds. Soybean yield values ranged between 3.16 and 2.01 t ha(-1), while CWP values varied from 1.05 to 0.67 kg m(-3). However, irrigating at seed enlargement and mature seeds, as well as applying only one irrigation of 100 mm at any growth stage, could lead to very low yields and CWP.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agwat.2008.04.009},
  abstract = {The DSSAT-CSM-CERES-Wheat V4.0 model was calibrated for yield and irrigation scheduling of wheat with 2004\textendash{}2005 data and validated with 13 independent data sets from experiments conducted during 2002\textendash{}2006 at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) farm, Ludhiana, and in a farmer's field near PAU at Phillaur, Punjab, India. Subsequently, the validated model was used to estimate long-term mean and variability of potential yield (Yp), drainage, runoff, evapo-transpiration (ET), crop water productivity (CWP), and irrigation water productivity (IWP) of wheat cv. PBW343 using 36 years (1970\textendash{}1971 to 2005\textendash{}2006) of historical weather data from Ludhiana. Seven sowing dates in fortnightly intervals, ranging from early October to early January, and three irrigation scheduling methods [soil water deficit (SWD)-based, growth stage-based, and ET-based] were evaluated. For the SWD-based scheduling, irrigation management depth was set to 75 cm with irrigation scheduled when SWD reached 50\% to replace 100\% of the deficit. For growth stage-based scheduling, irrigation was applied either only once at one of the key growth stages [crown root initiation (CRI), booting, flowering, and grain filling], twice (two stages in various combinations), thrice (three stages in various combinations), or four times (all four stages). For ET-driven irrigation, irrigations were scheduled based on cumulative net ETo (ETo-rain) since the previous irrigation, for a range of net ETo (25, 75, 125, 150, and 175 mm). Five main irrigation schedules (SWD-based, ET-driven with irrigation applied after accumulation of either 75 or 125 mm of ETo, i.e., ET75 or ET125, and growth stage-based with irrigation applied at CRI plus booting, or at CRI plus booting plus flowering stage) were chosen for detailed analysis of yield, water balance, and CWP and IWP. Nitrogen was non-limiting in all the simulations.

Mean Yp across 36 years ranged from 5.2 t ha-1 (10 October sowing) to 6.4 t ha-1 (10 November sowing), with yield variations due to seasonal weather greater than variations across sowing dates. Yields under different irrigation scheduling, CWP and IWP were highest for 10 November sowing. Yields and CWP were higher for SWD and ET75-based irrigations on both soils, but IWP was higher for ET75-based irrigation on sandy loam and for ET150-based irrigation on loam. Simulation results suggest that yields, CWP, and IWP of PBW343 would be highest for sowing between late October and mid-November in the Indian Punjab. It is recommended that sowing be done within this planting period and that irrigation be applied based on the atmospheric demand and soil water status and not on the growth stage. Despite the potential limitations recognised with simulation results, we can conclude that DSSAT-CSM-CERES-Wheat V4.0 is a useful decision support system to help farmers to optimally schedule and manage irrigation in wheat grown in coarse-textured soils under declining groundwater table situations of the Indian Punjab. Further, the validated model and the simulation results can also be extrapolated to other areas with similar climatic and soil environments in Asia where crop, soil, weather, and management data are available.},

  abstract = {Radiation use efficiency (\ensuremath{\varepsilon}) is a crop parameter widely used in crop simulation models, derived here as the slope of the relationship linking crop carbon gain to cumulative intercepted solar radiation. Our objectives were to: (i) determine \ensuremath{\varepsilon} of field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea, at three levels of aggregation\textemdash{}day-time net assimilation (A), daily net carbon gain as difference between A and night-time dark respiration (R) and biomass; (ii) assess the robustness of \ensuremath{\varepsilon} parameter in terms of ability to discriminate between C3 and C4 species, pre- and post-anthesis and impact of nitrogen status; (iii) evaluate the opportunity to normalize \ensuremath{\varepsilon} for climate. Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999 in southern Italy. All crops were well watered. Sunflower and sorghum had two nitrogen application treatments, wheat only one and chickpea had no added nitrogen. Daily intercepted solar radiation was derived from measurements of daily incident solar radiation and the percentage of mid-day light interception. Closed-system canopy chambers monitored canopy gas-exchange rates. \ensuremath{\varepsilon}, expressed in terms of A, A - R or above-ground biomass, was linear over the entire growth cycle of sorghum and wheat, and up to anthesis in sunflower and chickpea, independent of temperature, vapour pressure deficit and radiation regimes. In sunflower, deviation from linearity was observed after anthesis, due to higher carbon cost in yielding oil seeds. No conclusions could be drawn for post-anthesis chickpea due to the interruption of the experiment caused by a thunderstorm. Overall results showed a great variability in \ensuremath{\varepsilon} values, independently of classes of species (C4 and C3), crops and nitrogen treatments. This indicates that the robustness of \ensuremath{\varepsilon} to predict biomass productivity in crop simulation models is constrained. Attempts to normalize \ensuremath{\varepsilon} by vapour pressure deficit (D), for reducing its variability due to climate and overlaps between crops failed.},

  abstract = {Most of the world's hunger and poverty occurs in rural areas. The use of fertilizers could improve agricultural productivity in these areas. However, many developing countries attach a low priority to the subsistence/smallholder sector, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Properly applied, fertilizer use is sustainable, not only improving agricultural productivity but also helping to avoid land degradation. Incorrectly used, fertilizers may be harmful. In order to assess the present and potential efficiency of fertilizer use, it is necessary to know, for each agro-ecological region of each country: the crops on which fertilizers are being used; the social and structural context; appropriate fertilizer application rates; the profitability of fertilizer application at these rates; the arrangements for supplying fertilizers to farmers and for marketing their produce; the credit facilities available to farmers and distributors; whether sufficient research on appropriate fertilization techniques is being carried out; and whether the resulting information is reaching the farmers. This publication reviews these various issues, substantiated by examples from each country, and analyzes available statistics on fertilizer use by crop.--Publisher's description.},

  abstract = {The portending process of climate change, induced by the anthropogenic accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is likely to generate effects that will cascade through the biosphere, impacting all life on earth and bearing upon human endeavors. Of special concern is the potential effect on agriculture and global food security.  Anticipating these effects demands that scientists widen their field of vision and cooperate across disciplines to encompass increasingly complex interactions. Trans-disciplinary cooperation should aim to generate effective responses to the portending changes, including actions to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases and to adapt to those climate changes that cannot be avoided.  This handbook presents an exposition of current research on the impacts, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change in relation to agroecosystems. It is offered as the first volume in what is intended to be an ongoing series dedicated to elucidating the interactions of climate change with a broad range of sectors and systems, and to developing and spurring effective responses to this global challenge. As the collective scientific and practical knowledge of the processes and responses involved continues to grow, future volumes in the series will address important aspects of the topic periodically over the coming years.},

  abstract = {In the UK, wheat is the most important cultivated cereal, grown extensively as a rainfed crop. Irrigation of wheat has previously been considered uneconomic, but increases in world wheat prices and recent droughts have led to some farmers revising their views. Widespread adoption of wheat irrigation would have major implications for wheat production, the irrigation industry and water resources in regions that are already water scarce. This study investigated the financial viability of irrigating winter wheat grown on a sandy loam soil in the East of England. Long-term climate data (1961\textendash{}2011) for Silsoe (Bedfordshire) was used to drive a biophysical crop model to assess irrigation water requirements and yield response. Modelling assumed a typical irrigation schedule to maximise yield and quality, and average reported wheat prices for 2007 to 2012. Irrigation costs were calculated assuming an overhead mobile hosereel\textendash{}raingun system applying river water, abstracted either in summer and used directly, or abstracted in winter and stored in an on-farm reservoir.

The results suggest that the yield benefit would justify supplemental irrigation by farmers who have unused irrigation equipment and unused summer water, although irrigation of higher-value field vegetable crops later in the season would normally take precedence \textendash{} the Added Value of Water (AVW) usefully applied to milling winter wheat under these conditions ranged between 0.24 and 0.32\,\textsterling{}\,m-3. Investment in new irrigation schemes could also be marginally viable if unused summer river water was available for direct abstraction (AVW\,=\,0.08\,\textsterling{}\,m-3). Investments in new farm reservoirs for irrigating wheat are currently not profitable (AVW\,=\,\textendash{}0.23\,\textsterling{}\,m-3). Sensitivity analysis suggests that in the longer term, the expected increase in world wheat prices and the impacts of climate change are likely to make the financial benefits stronger, particularly in the drier catchments further east and on low moisture retentive soils, but competing demands for water would still make extensive wheat irrigation unlikely.},

Particular focus is given to the savannah zone, covering 40\% of the land area in the world, where water scarcity constitutes a serious constraint to sustainable development. The analysis indicates an urgent need for a new green revolution, which focuses on upgrading rain\textendash{}fed agriculture.
Water requirements to produce adequate diets for humans are shown to be relatively generic irrespective of hydro\textendash{}climate, amounting to a global average of 1300 m3 cap-1 yr-1. Present food production requires an estimated 6800 km3 yr-1 of consumptive green water (5000 km3 yr-1 in rain\textendash{}fed agriculture and 1800 km3 yr-1 from irrigated crops). Without considering water productivity gains, an additional 5800 km3 yr-1 of water is needed to feed a growing population in 2050 and eradicate malnutrition. It is shown that the bulk of this water will be used in rain\textendash{}fed agriculture.
A dynamic analysis of water productivity and management options indicates that large `crop per drop' improvements can be achieved at the farm level. Vapour shift in favour of productive green water flow as crop transpiration could result in relative water savings of 500 km3 yr-1 in semi\textendash{}arid rain\textendash{}fed agriculture.},

We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed.},

  abstract = {Summary
Knowledge of the virtual water content (VWC) of crops and especially its possible future developments is helpful for improvements in water productivity and water management, which are necessary at global scale due to rising demand for food, the necessity to ease present and future water scarcity, and the reduction of poverty. Using a dynamic global vegetation and water balance model (LPJmL), this study quantifies the VWC of two of the most important crop types worldwide, temperate cereals and maize, at high spatial resolution (0.5\ensuremath{^\circ}). We analyzed present conditions (1999\textendash{}2003) and also for the first time also for scenarios of future climate and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations (2041\textendash{}2070; HadCM3, ECHAM5 and CCSM3 climate models, A2 emissions scenario). VWC presently differs significantly among regions: highest values are common in large parts of Africa (\&gt;2 m3 kg-1), and lowest values were found e.g. for Central Europe (\&lt;0.5 m3 kg-1), indicating that water-use efficiency of crops is much higher in the latter region. The regional patterns of VWC result from complex and interactive processes; the dominant factor is the crop yield level (high VWC values occur most frequently in regions with low yields). Climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration will have non-uniform effects on crop yields and evapotranspiration. Worldwide VWC patterns will change significantly, with a pronounced regional pattern that reflects primarily the changes in yields as driven mainly by regionally decreasing precipitation, increasing temperature and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. Although globally the water-use efficiency is projected to increase, many regions\textemdash{}including parts of the US, East and Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, Argentina, Australia and South East Asia\textemdash{}are projected to become less water efficient (higher VWC) for at least one of the crop types. CO2 fertilisation was simulated to generally reduce VWC, though realisation of this effect in the field will depend, for example, on the intensity of nutrient management in the future. The potentially adverse future changes in VWC found here pose a challenge to water management efforts and eventually global trade policies.},

On-station field trials were established over two consecutive years at the Naphok and Veunkham sites in Laos. At each site, 10 treatments were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments were control, rice husk biochar (10 t ha-1), bentonite clay (10 t ha-1), compost (4 t ha-1), clay-manure compost (10 t ha-1), rice husk biochar compost (10 t ha-1), bentonite clay + biochar, bentonite-clay + compost, biochar + compost, and bentonite clay + biochar + compost. All treatments were applied in 2011. Significant (p \ensuremath{<} 0.05) treatment effects in CWP and growing period evapotranspiration were determined. At Naphok, differences between the amended and control plots in CWP varied between 0.1 and 0.6 kg m-3 in 2011 and from 0.1 to 0.4 kg m-3 in 2012, whereas differences at Veunkham varied between 0.3 and 1.0 kg m-3 in 2011 and from 0.05 to 0.29 kg m-3 in 2012. At both sites, CWP in 2012 was significantly lower than 2011. Our results illustrate that organic- and clay-based soil amendments improve CWP, indicating that soil-based interventions could be suitable options for improving agricultural productivity.},

Precipitation had a greater impact on agricultural runoff compared to changes in either CO2 concentration or temperature. Increase of precipitation by \ensuremath{\pm}10\% and \ensuremath{\pm}20\% generally changed agricultural runoff proportionally. Solely increasing CO2 concentration resulted in an increase in nitrate, phosphorus, and chlorpyrifos yield by 4.2, 7.8, and 6.4\%, respectively, and a decrease in sediment and diazinon yield by 6.3 and 5.3\%, respectively, in comparison to the present-day reference scenario. Only increasing temperature reduced yields of all agricultural runoff components. The results suggest that agricultural runoff in the San Joaquin watershed is sensitive to precipitation, temperature, and CO2 concentration changes.},

  abstract = {The potential of a copula model for the description of the joint probability distribution of two agricultural drought characteristics, the relative onset RO and the relative severity RS, is investigated in Perugia (Central Italy) in reference to a sunflower crop. The 1924\textendash{}2009 time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were used to simulate, by means of the AquaCrop model, the root-zone soil water dynamics (SW t ) and the crop yield under rainfed conditions. The seasonal values of RO and RS were quantified, by applying the theory of runs to SW t (assumed as the drought reference variable), with a threshold equal to the crop critical point. The analysis shows that the best-fitting marginal distribution for both RO and RS is a truncated Gumbel distribution. The dependence structure of RO and RS, investigated by graphical and analytical techniques, was modeled by a Student copula, which is able to adequately reproduce both the overall and upper tail dependence among variables. Lastly, the Student copula was applied to obtain joint probabilities and bivariate return periods for RO and RS. These results, compared with the expected estimated yields, provide useful information for drought planning and management. For example, for the case study considered, it was found that the condition RO \ensuremath{\geq} 0.43 (i.e., onset before the end of June) and RS \ensuremath{\geq} 0.22 has a 5-year return period and is frequently associated with critical yields, and that the condition RO \ensuremath{\geq} 0.47 (i.e., onset before mid-June) and RS \ensuremath{\geq} 0.25 has a 10-year return period and is almost certainly associated with critical yields.},

  abstract = {The field experiments were conducted to study the evapotranspiration (ET), evaporation (E), growth, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of plastic-mulched spring wheat with hole planting in 1990 and 1991 under full and deficit irrigation at Zhangye Station of Water-saving Agriculture, Gansu Academy of Agricultural Science in northwest China. The experiment was designed to maintain minimum soil water content (MSWC) to different levels: 85\%, 70\%, 60\%, 50\%, 40\% of field capacity in rooting depth and treatment to be nonirrigation. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block with four replications, and a non-mulched replication as control. The study indicated plastic mulched had higher ET than non-mulched due to increase of LAI. Seasonal ET was 269 mm for the plastic-mulch treatments with MSWC 40\% and 765 mm with MSWC 85\%, increased 19.8\% and 2\% than non-mulched, respectively. The ET rates of mulch treatments were lower before tillering, and higher after tillering. Plastic mulching could decreased evaporation from soil by 55\% in comparison with non-mulched for the treatment of 60\% MSWC. The yield was the highest with treatment of MSWC 60\% in 1990 and 70\% in 1991, and it was significantly higher than treatments of MSWC 40\% and nonirrigation. However, there were not significant differences in yield when MSWC were between 50\% and 85\%. The water use efficiency (WUE) of the plastic-mulched treatment reduced with the increase in MSWC. They were 0.86 kg m-3 for the treatment of MSWC 85\% in 1990 and 0.89 kg m-3 in 1991, significantly lower than MSWC 40\textendash{}60\% and nonirrigation. There were increases of 0.9\textendash{}30.8\% in ET and 4.0\textendash{}110.3\% in yield for all plastic-mulched treatment over non-mulch. The WUE with plastic mulch was 2\textendash{}61\% higher than non-mulch, and the difference increased with the decreasing of MSWC. The net seasonal income, benefit\textendash{}cost ratio and net profit per mm of water used were bigger compared with non-mulched under less than 60\% MSWC, however they became smaller from 60\% up to 85\%.

Finally, results revealed that spring wheat mulched with plastic maintained higher WUE and net income than non-mulched under low soil water content, which makes it suitable for deficit irrigation in arid circumstance.},

  abstract = {Common problems faced by rainfall\textendash{}runoff modellers are data limitation, model overparameterization and related problems of parameter identifiability. Depending on the application, possible solutions to overcome these problems include the use of parsimonious conceptual models, avoid the use of a fixed pre-defined model conceptualization, but apply a ``top-down'' or ``downward'' method to allow the model structure to be adjusted or inferred from available data and field evidence.
This paper presents a top-down procedure that starts from a generalized model structure framework that is adjusted in a case-specific parsimonious way. The model-structure building is done in a transparent, step-wise way, where separate parts of the model structure are identified and calibrated based on multiple and non-commensurable information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the high frequency (e.g., hourly, daily) river flow series into subflows, split of the series in approx. independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of independent peak and low flows. The model building and calibration account for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals. Next to identification of the subflow recessions and related routing submodels, equations describing quick and slow runoff sub-responses and soil water storage are derived from the time series data. The method includes testing of the model performance for peak and low flow extremes.},

  abstract = {Although the relationship between individual plant traits and competitive success in communities is an essential component of comprehensive models of the role of competition in structuring plant communities, three obstacles have stymied efforts to empirically examine such relationships. First, definitions of competitive ability are often inconsistent among bodies of theory and between theoretical predictions and empirical research. Much of the theoretical literature is for populations and often at equilibrium, while experimental work has been largely on individuals and short term. This situation is likely to continue, except for a few model systems, and therefore it is critical that individual-level surrogates for population-level phenomena be found. I suggest that competitive response of seedlings to established vegetation may be an effective surrogate for estimating competitive success of populations at equilibrium and that competitive response of individuals with more similar-sized neighbours may be an effective surrogate for competitive success of populations earlier in succession or in non-equilibrium systems. Second, competitive ability may be contingent on many factors, such that it may not be an identifiable characteristic of any particular taxon and thus no broadly applicable relationships between traits and competitive ability may exist. However, a literature survey shows that both competitive response and competitive effect are generally, but not always, consistent regardless of identity of competing species, making the search for relationships with traits reasonable, at least within environments. Among environments, both competitive effect and competitive response are consistent in only about half the studies, making it unreasonable to assume a priori that competitive hierarchies will be similar under different conditions. The third obstacle is logistical; competitive ability is necessarily measured experimentally, and preferably in the field, making it difficult to obtain sufficient sample sizes (numbers of taxa) for rigorous analysis of relationships with traits. I suggest several simplifying assumptions and experimental approaches that could enable much more efficient assaying of competitive abilities of many species.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2009.09.005},
  abstract = {Soil fertility and climate risks are hampering crop production in the Sahelian region. Because experiments with only a few fertility management options on a limited number of sites and years cannot fully capture the complex and highly non-linear soil\textendash{}climate\textendash{}crop interactions, crop growth simulation models may suitably complement experimental research to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. By means of a long term (23 years) scenario analysis using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, this study investigates millet response to N in view of establishing N recommendations better adapted to subsistence small-holder millet farming in the Sahel. Prior to this, the APSIM model was tested on a rainfed randomized complete block experiment carried out during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons, having contrasting rainfall conditions. The experiment combined, at three levels each, the application of cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha-1), millet residue (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha-1) and mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15 kg N ha-1 + 4.4 kg P ha-1 and 45 kg N ha-1 + 13.1 kg P ha-1) at ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Niger. The model suitably predicted plant available water PAW and the simulated water and nitrogen stress were in agreement with measurement (water) and expectation (N) regarding the fertilizer and rainfall conditions of the experiment. APSIM simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the observed crop growth except for the highest crop residue application rates (\&gt;900 kg ha-1). For biomass and grain yield, the model performance was relatively good in 1994 but biomass yields were slightly overpredicted in 1995. The model was able to adequately reproduce the average trend of millet grain yield response to N inputs from manure and fertilizer, and to predict the overall observed higher grain yield in 1995 compared to 1994, despite the better rainfall in 1994. The 23-year, long term scenario analysis combining different application rates of cattle manure, millet residue and mineral fertilizer, showed that moderate N application (15 kg N ha-1) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield without increasing inter-annual variability compared to no N input. Although it does imply a lower average yield than at 30 kg N ha-1, the application of 15 kg N ha-1 appears more appropriate for small-holder, subsistence farmers than the usual 30 kg N ha-1 recommendation as it guarantees higher minimum yield in worst years, thereby reducing their vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the major grain crop grown in western Canada (Canadian Prairies) and soil water stress is considered the main limiting factor for crop growth. The objective of this study was to adapt and test the ability of the FAO developed AquaCrop model (v3.0) to simulate spring wheat yield and total soil water content (0\textendash{}120 cm layer) on the Canadian Prairies. Crop yield and soil water content data collected from five experimental sites across the Canadian Prairies from 2003 through 2006 were used in the study. Results showed that the AquaCrop model can be used to model both wheat grain yield and soil water content on the Canadian Prairies with acceptable accuracy. Overall, the relationship between observed and modelled wheat grain yield for all sites combined produced a R2 of 0.66, slope of 0.96, index of agreement (d) of 0.99, root mean square error (RMSE) of 743 kg ha-1 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 611 kg ha-1. Similarly, the comparison between observed and modelled soil water content yielded a R2 of 0.90, slope of 0.73, d of 0.99, RMSE of 49 mm and MAE of 40 mm. The difference between observed and modelled grain yield was only 3\%, while that between observed and modelled total soil water was 2\%. Consequently, AquaCrop can be a valuable tool for simulating both wheat grain yield and soil water content on the Canadian Prairies, particularly considering the fact that the model requires a relatively small number of explicit and mostly intuitive input data which can be readily available or easily collected. However, the performance of the model has to be evaluated and fine-tuned under a wider range of conditions, which we hope will be the next step.},

  abstract = {As previous co-workers of Dr. Jans Wesseling, who headed the Department of Water Management of the Institute for Land and Water Management Research, i.e. the `Instituut voor Cultuurtechniek en Waterhuishouding' (ICW), Wageningen from 1959 to 1987, we have written the present review article. We start with a short description of the hydrological problems, with a particular focus on groundwater, that affect agriculture in humid and temperate climates such as that of the Netherlands as well as in semi-arid climates. We then describe the highlights of the scientific career of Dr. Wesseling, who inspired us and colleagues that have worked with soil water flow under both saturated and unsaturated conditions in relation to the creation of optimal conditions for plant growth and yield. This is followed by an overview of the transient flow modeling of water and solute flow in heterogeneous soil\textendash{}root systems under a variety of boundary conditions with a focus on the linkage between water use by the crop, and daily crop growth and crop yield, i.e. the so-called `water productivity' relationship. Then the agreement between long-term predictions made with dynamic land capability models and field measurements are discussed in the context of model utility to establish design criteria for drainage systems for both humid as well as for semi-arid areas.

We then review how to scale up from the field scale to the regional scale. Up-scaling from fields to a region can be done by identifying areas that are homogenous with respect to soil and hydrological properties. Effects of spatial heterogeneity can be further analyzed by running a field scale model for all combinations of soil\textendash{}water\textendash{}crop and weather combinations, i.e. simulation units for the areas under investigation. The aggregation of the various simulation units can be performed in a GIS-environment by overlaying the thematic maps of spatial variables like weather, land use, soil, irrigation, groundwater level and groundwater quality. In order to analyze water productivity at regional scale the output of the independent model runs can finally be synthesized with the help of post-processors and GIS.

On the other hand earth observation satellites provide nowadays interesting information about degree of vegetation cover, leaf area index, crop type, crop yield, crop water stress and crop water use. This information can be regularly obtained under cloud-free conditions for different spatial and time resolutions. Consequently, the accuracy and reliability of spatial aggregation of representative input parameters, evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass simulated by distributed modelling can be compared with data obtained by satellite for different spatial and temporal scales. Once the combined use of model predictions and satellite data is verified, it will be possible to analyze the water productivity of an entire region of interest in detail and to provide specific recommendations for improvement.},

  abstract = {The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries\textemdash{}climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash{}have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES\textemdash{}its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low\textemdash{}a ``safe operating space'' for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier ``biodiversity loss''), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs\textemdash{}climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash{}are recognized as ``core'' PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth's surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability
The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.

  abstract = {In sub-mountain tract of Punjab state of India, maize (Zea mays, L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops are grown as rainfed having low crop and water productivity. To enhance that, proper understanding of the factors (soil type, climate, management practices and their interactions) affecting it is a pre-requisite. The present study aims to assess the effects of tillage, date of sowing, and irrigation practices on the rainfed maize\textendash{}wheat cropping system involving combined approach of field study and simulation. Field experiments comprising 18 treatments (three dates of sowing as main, three tillage systems as subplot and two irrigation regimes as the sub-subplot) were conducted for two years (2004\textendash{}2006) and simulations were made for 15 years using CropSyst model. Field and simulated results showed that grain yields of maize and wheat crops were more in early July planted maize and early November planted wheat on silt loam soil. Different statistical parameters (root mean square error, coefficient of residual mass, model efficiency, coefficient of correlation and paired t-test) indicated that CropSyst model did fair job to simulate biomass production and grain yield for maize\textendash{}wheat cropping system under varying soil texture, date of planting and irrigation regimes.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement (IWR) and yield for rainfed rice and irrigated paddy, respectively, at Ngamoeyeik Irrigation Project in Myanmar. Climate projections from two General Circulation Models, namely ECHAM5 and HadCM3 were derived for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The climate variables were downscaled to basin level by using the Statistical DownScaling Model. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the yield and IWR under future climate. The analysis shows a decreasing trend in maximum temperature for three scenarios and three time windows considered; however, an increasing trend is observed for minimum temperature for all cases. The analysis on precipitation also suggests that rainfall in wet season is expected to vary largely from -29 to +21.9\% relative to the baseline period. A higher variation is observed for the rainfall in dry season ranging from -42\% for 2080s, and +96\% in the case of 2020s. A decreasing trend of IWR is observed for irrigated paddy under the three scenarios indicating that small irrigation schemes are suitable to meet the requirements. An increasing trend in the yield of rainfed paddy was estimated under climate change demonstrating increased food security in the region.},

  abstract = {Dryland agriculture under rainfed conditions is found mainly in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. In the harsh environments of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and West Asia and North Africa (WANA), water is the principal factor limiting crop yield. A review has been carried out on soil and crop management research that can increase the water use efficiency.

The WANA production systems are dominated by cereals, primarily wheat in the wetter and barley in the drier areas, in rotation with mainly food legumes such as chickpea, lentil and forage legumes. The SSA production systems are generally characterized by cereal/legume mixed-cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. The major constraints in both regions to crop production are low soil fertility, insecure rainfall, low-productive genotypes, low adoption of improved soil and crop management practices, and lack of appropriate institutional support.

Different cropping systems and accompanying technologies are discussed as well as selected examples of impact of these technologies. Results indicate that there is an advantage to apply these technologies but being function of socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. It is recommended that future research focuses on integrated technology development while taking into account also different levels of scale such as field, village, and watershed.},

In addition, three case studies of water harvesting are presented (see annex). These were selected from the case studies presented at the FAO Expert Consultation Cairo (1994). By sharing with us the success and the failure of these endeavors, the authors of the case studies illustrate many of the points that are made in the text. They also illustrate how difficult it is to successfully introduce new technologies to farmers, who at the outset are not usually familiar with the intended purpose of the changes. Also, this paper emphasises that it is difficult to assess the potential for adoption without more studies to assess the risks and economic returns of the alternative techniques and practices.},

This short review gives a personal perspective on the scope and value of models of crop processes and performance, in the context of the increasing demand to make predictions about the best course of action for farmers. The goal for these predictions can range from the best rate or timing for a pesticide spray to the likely pressure on the farming community if predicted levels of climate change are realised. The primary conclusion is that a clear statement of objectives is the most important precursor to the use of models of crop processes or systems.},

  abstract = {Water is critically important to the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people living on less than \$1 a day, particularly for the 850 million rural poor primarily engaged in agriculture. In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear. This article provides a menu of promising pathways through which agricultural water management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction.},

  abstract = {An essential part of hydrological research focuses on hydrological extremes, such as river peak flows and associated floods, because of their large impact on economy, environment, and human life. These extremes can be affected by potential future environmental change, including global climate change and land cover change. In this paper, the relative impact of both climate change and urban expansion on the peak flows and flood extent is investigated for a small-scale suburban catchment in Belgium. A rainfall-runoff model was coupled to a hydrodynamic model in order to simulate the present-day and future river streamflow. The coupled model was calibrated based on a series of measured water depths and, after model validation, fed with different climate change and urban expansion scenarios in order to evaluate the relative impact of both driving factors on the peak flows and flood extent. The three climate change scenarios that were used (dry, wet winter, wet summer) were based on a statistical downscaling of 58 different RCM and GCM scenario runs. The urban expansion scenarios were based on three different urban growth rates (low, medium, high urban expansion) that were set up by means of an extrapolation of the observed trend of urban expansion. The results suggest that possible future climate change is the main source of uncertainty affecting changes in peak flow and flood extent. The urban expansion scenarios show a more consistent trend. The potential damage related to a flood is, however, mainly influenced by land cover changes that occur in the floodplain. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Defining crop response to water is a crucial part of decision-making for agricultural water management. This study is proposing an efficient and a low-cost approach to validate FAO's AquaCrop model using remote sensing (RS) estimates instead of crop ground measurements. A radiance use efficiency (RUE) based RS model for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) is proposed with Landsat images and regional crop information. The RS estimates are used to validate AquaCrop's built-in crops and calibrate it under salinity stress. As a result, RS estimates of canopy cover (CC) and AGB were produced from an existing CC model and the proposed AGB model, respectively. These estimates became good replacements of the ground measurements for validation and calibration. Built-in maize of AquaCrop showed good agreement between simulations and RS estimates under non-stress conditions whereas built-in barley underestimated AGB compared to the RS estimates. By comparing the RS estimates in salinity-affected farms to AquaCrop simulations without considering salinity stress, AGB reduction due to salinity stress and corresponding CC reduction were quantified for calibration of AquaCrop under salinity stress. The results of calibration predicted initial soil salinity of saline-stressed farms and the values are within the possible ranges. The proposed methodology shows that the readily available Landsat images and regional crop information could extend the validation of built-in crops of AquaCrop to regions without ground measurements.},

  abstract = {It is surprisingly difficult to determine whether water is truly scarce in the physical sense at a global scale (a supply problem) or whether it is available but should be used better (a demand problem). The paper reviews water scarcity indicators and global assessments based on these indicators. The most widely used indicator, the Falkenmark indicator, is popular because it is easy to apply and understand but it does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity. The more complex indicators are not widely applied because data are lacking to apply them and the definitions are not intuitive. Water is definitely physically scarce in densely populated arid areas, Central and West Asia, and North Africa, with projected availabilities of less than 1000 m3/capita/year. This scarcity relates to water for food production, however, and not to water for domestic purposes that are minute at this scale. In most of the rest of the world water scarcity at a national scale has as much to do with the development of the demand as the availability of the supply. Accounting for water for environmental requirements shows that abstraction of water for domestic, food and industrial uses already have a major impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world, even those not considered ``water scarce''. Water will be a major constraint for agriculture in coming decades and particularly in Asia and Africa this will require major institutional adjustments. A ``soft path'' to address water scarcity, focusing on increasing overall water productivity, is recommended.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.eja.2015.04.008},
  abstract = {In crop insurance, the accuracy with which the insurer quantifies the actual risk is highly dependent on the availability on actual yield data. Crop models might be valuable tools to generate data on expected yields for risk assessment when no historical records are available. However, selecting a crop model for a specific objective, location and implementation scale is a difficult task. A look inside the different crop and soil modules to understand how outputs are obtained might facilitate model choice. The objectives of this paper were (i) to assess the usefulness of crop models to be used within a crop insurance analysis and design and (ii) to select the most suitable crop model for drought risk assessment in semi-arid regions in Spain. For that purpose first, a pre-selection of crop models simulating wheat yield under rainfed growing conditions at the field scale was made, and second, four selected models (Aquacrop, CERES-Wheat, CropSyst and WOFOST) were compared in terms of modelling approaches, process descriptions and model outputs. Outputs of the four models for the simulation of winter wheat growth are comparable when water is not limiting, but differences are larger when simulating yields under rainfed conditions. These differences in rainfed yields are mainly related to the dissimilar simulated soil water availability and the assumed linkages with dry matter formation. We concluded that for the simulation of winter wheat growth at field scale in such semi-arid conditions, CERES-Wheat and CropSyst are preferred. WOFOST is a satisfactory compromise between data availability and complexity when detail data on soil is limited. Aquacrop integrates physiological processes in some representative parameters, thus diminishing the number of input parameters, what is seen as an advantage when observed data is scarce. However, the high sensitivity of this model to low water availability limits its use in the region considered. Contrary to the use of ensembles of crop models, we endorse that efforts be concentrated on selecting or rebuilding a model that includes approaches that better describe the agronomic conditions of the regions in which they will be applied. The use of such complex methodologies as crop models is associated with numerous sources of uncertainty, although these models are the best tools available to get insight in these complex agronomic systems.},

A global, yet spatially disaggregated, green-blue analysis of water availability and requirement, using the LPJmL dynamic vegetation and water balance model, indicates that many countries currently assessed as severely water short are able to produce enough food for their populations if green water is considered and is managed well. The need to integrate green and blue water management is highlighted in a future scenario of water availability under climate change and population growth (HadCM2 A2). For 2050, the scenario indicates that 59\% of the world population will face blue water shortage, and 36\% will face green and blue water shortage. Even under climate change, good options to build water resilience exist without further expansion of cropland, particularly through management of local green water resources that reduces risks for dry spells and agricultural droughts.},

  abstract = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET o ) is an essential component of irrigation water management due to it being a basic input for estimating crop water requirements. Multiple approaches have been identified for ET o assessment but most of them are based on daily meteorological data provided by weather station networks that provide an accurate meteorological characterization. A new alternative approach called MA+LSE based on the Makkink-Advection (MAK-Adv) equation in combination with remotely sensed solar radiation and a numerical weather forecast of near surface air temperature has provided good estimates of ET o under different weather conditions in a semi-arid region located in Southern Spain, without requiring local meteorological data. In order to evaluate the utility of the MA+LSE approach for irrigation water management, some well-known methods for ET o assessment and the MA+LSE approach were considered for the development of irrigation schedules in ten irrigation schemes located in a semi-arid region in Southern Spain. The impact of the approach considered for ET o assessment on irrigation scheduling and on simulated yield for a maize crop was determined. Thus, MA+LSE and Hargreaves methods generated similar irrigation schedules and estimated yield to those determined by using ET o from the Penman-Monteith (PM-FAO56) approach. Thus, average seasonal irrigation volume estimated by MA+LSE was underestimated by around 2.6\%, causing a yield reduction of 2.2\% compared with the irrigation scheduling based on PM-FAO56. These results confirm the applicability of the MA+LSE approach, especially in areas where meteorological data are missing or inaccurate, obtaining a similar performance for irrigation water management to that of other approaches with high data requirements such as PM-FAO56. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Four years of soybean experimental data observed at Daxing, North China Plain, were used to assess the ability of the AquaCrop model to predict soybean final biomass and yield. The model was parameterized and calibrated using field data on leaf area index (LAI), available soil water, soil evaporation, biomass and final yield data. The model was assessed using calibrated and default parameters. Data on LAI were used to derive the fraction of ground cover and to calibrate the green canopy cover (CC) curve. An accurate calibration of the CC curve was performed, with low root mean square errors (RMSE \ensuremath{<} 73\%). Results relative to soil water balance simulations show a high variability of the predictions, thus a bias of the estimation, with R-2 ranging 0.22-0.86 and low Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency EF, ranging between -0.47 and 0.82. The estimation errors were relatively high, with RMSE not exceeding 22.9 mm. AquaCrop was compared with the soil water balance model SIMDualKc, that has shown better performance with R-2 \ensuremath{>}= 0.83, EF generally greater than 0.75 and RMSE smaller than 12.5 mm. The soil evaporation (E-s) simulations were compared with the observations performed using microlysimeters; results for Aquacrop have shown a clear trend for under-estimation of E-s, with "goodness-of-fit" results worse than for SIMDualKc (Wei et al., 2015). In general, AquaCrop has shown serious limitations to estimate crop transpiration or soil evaporation, which is likely due to abandoning the FAO dual K-c approach. However, the model performed well relative to biomass and yield predictions, with a yield RMSE of 302 kg ha(-1). Overall, results show the adequacy of AquaCrop for estimating soybean biomass and yield when the model is appropriately parameterized. However, AquaCrop is not appropriate to support irrigation scheduling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the water implications in 92 developing countries of first attaining the 2015 hunger target of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and then feeding a growing population on an acceptable standard diet. The water requirements in terms of vapor flows are quantified, potential water sources are identified, and impacts on agricultural land expansion and water tradeoffs with ecosystems are analyzed. This article quantifies the relative contribution from infiltrated rainwater/green water in rain-fed agriculture, and liquid water/blue water from irrigation, and how far water productivity (WP) gains can go in reducing the pressure on freshwater resources. Under current WP levels, another 2,200 km3\ensuremath{\cdot}yr-1 of vapor flow is deemed necessary to halve hunger by 2015 and 5,200 km3\ensuremath{\cdot}yr-1 in 2050 to alleviate hunger. A nonlinear relationship between vapor flow and yield growth, particularly in low-yielding savanna agro-ecosystems, indicates a high potential for WP increase. Such WP gains may reduce additional water needs in agriculture, with 16\% in 2015 and 45\% by 2050. Despite an optimistic outlook on irrigation development, most of the additional water will originate from rain-fed production. Yield growth, increasing consumptive use on existing rain-fed cropland, and fodder from grazing lands may reduce the additional rain-fed water use further by 43\textendash{}47\% until 2030. To meet remaining water needs, a cropland expansion of \ensuremath{\approx}0.8\% yr-1, i.e., a similar rate as over the past 50 years (\ensuremath{\approx}0.65\% yr-1), seems unavoidable if food production is to occur in proximity to local markets.},

Three levels of irrigation interval included pond treatment, five days interval, and eight days interval, and consisted of four levels of nitrogen. The study results showed that there were significant differences among study crop models in simulation of grain and biological yield in response to different irrigation intervals. As results showed, study models performed more accurate in estimation of rice yield under irrigation intervals than nitrogen levels. All models illustrated high performance in estimation of rice yield under different irrigation intervals. CERES-Rice and AquaCrop models showed highest accuracy in simulation of grain and biological yield of rice under different levels of nitrogen, respectively. In addition, CERES-Rice model indicated highest performance in simulation of grain yield (rRMSE = 16). However, AquaCrop model estimated biological yield more accurate compared to other models (rRMSE = 15).

  abstract = {Rain-fed lowland rice is by far the most common production system in south eastern Tanzania. Rice is typically cultivated in river valleys and plains on diverse soil types although heavy soil types are preferred as they can retain moisture for a longer period. To assess the effects of soil bunds on the production of rain-fed lowland rice, the crop was cultivated in bunded and non-bunded farmers' plots under the common agronomic practices in the region, in three successive seasons on Grumic Calcic Vertisols (Pellic). For the three seasons and for the two plot types, crop transpiration was simulated with the BUDGET soil water balance model by using the observed weather data, soil and crop parameters. Comparison between the observed yields and the simulated crop transpiration yielded an exponential relationship with a determination factor of 0.87 and an RMSE of 0.15 tonnes ha-1. With the validated soil water balance model crop yields that can be expected in bunded and non-bunded fields were subsequently simulated for wet, normal and dry years and various environmental conditions. Yield comparison shows that soil bunds can appreciably increase the production of rain-fed lowland rice in south eastern Tanzania in three quarters of the years (wet and normal years) when the soil profile is slow draining (KSAT equal to or less than 10 mm day-1). In normal years a minimum yield increase of 30\% may be expected on those soil types. In wet years and when the soil hardly drains (drainage class of 0\textendash{}5 mm day-1), the yield may even double. In dry years the yield increase will be most of the time less than 10\% except for plots with a percolation rate of 0\textendash{}5 mm day-1.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2014.11.001},
  abstract = {In the UK, wheat is the most important cultivated cereal, grown extensively as a rainfed crop. Irrigation of wheat has previously been considered uneconomic, but increases in world wheat prices and recent droughts have led to some farmers revising their views. Widespread adoption of wheat irrigation would have major implications for wheat production, the irrigation industry and water resources in regions that are already water scarce. This study investigated the financial viability of irrigating winter wheat grown on a sandy loam soil in the East of England. Long-term climate data (1961-2011) for Silsoe (Bedfordshire) was used to drive a biophysical crop model to assess irrigation water requirements and yield response. Modelling assumed a typical irrigation schedule to maximise yield and quality, and average reported wheat prices for 2007 to 2012. Irrigation costs were calculated assuming an overhead mobile hosereel-raingun system applying river water, abstracted either in summer and used directly, or abstracted in winter and stored in an on-farm reservoir. The results suggest that the yield benefit would justify supplemental irrigation by farmers who have unused irrigation equipment and unused summer water, although irrigation of higher-value field vegetable crops later in the season would normally take precedence - the Added Value of Water (AVW) usefully applied to milling winter wheat under these conditions ranged between 0.24 and 0.32 pound m(-3). Investment in new irrigation schemes could also be marginally viable if unused summer river water was available for direct abstraction (AVW = 0.08 pound m(-3)). Investments in new farm reservoirs for irrigating wheat are currently not profitable (AVW = -0.23 pound m(-3)). Sensitivity analysis suggests that in the longer term, the expected increase in world wheat prices and the impacts of climate change are likely to make the financial benefits stronger, particularly in the drier catchments further east and on low moisture retentive soils, but competing demands for water would still make extensive wheat irrigation unlikely.

  abstract = {A precise prediction of the yield losses inflicted by weeds is the basis of decisions in weed management. Hitherto, only rough estimates, which neglect the specific production situation, have been available for vegetable crops. In this study a simple simulation model was developed to estimate yield loss by radiation competition as a function of environmental variables. In the model, the distribution of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the canopy is calculated using a spatially highly resolved approach. Growth is calculated as a function of absorbed radiation and its utilisation. Newly produced dry matter is allocated to roots and shoots, the latter comprising vegetative and reproductive organs according to the developmental stage. Vegetative shoot dry matter is partitioned according to the main functions of radiation interception (leaves) and structural stability (stems and petioles). The resulting leaf area is distributed in the canopy according to the spatial expansion of individual plants. Calibration runs revealed uncertainties predicting the growth of Chenopodium album and a high sensitivity of crop yield to leaf area development of the weed. Using the area of green leaves (LAI) of C. album as input gave a close correspondence between simulated and observed crop yield loss. Since plant height of C. album is calculated as a function of leaf area, this variable has a multiple effect on radiation absorption. A first evaluation with an independent data set likewise gave an acceptable prediction. To reduce model complexity, a simplified version is proposed.},

These data are pooled and compared with equivalent North American dose\textendash{}response relationships. The Asian data show that at ambient O3 concentrations found at the study sites (which vary between \ensuremath{\sim}35\textendash{}75~ppb 4\textendash{}8~h growing season mean), yield losses for wheat, rice and legumes range between 5\textendash{}48, 3\textendash{}47 and 10\textendash{}65\%, respectively. The results indicate that Asian grown wheat and rice cultivars are more sensitive to O3 than the North American dose\textendash{}response relationships would suggest. For legumes the scatter in the data makes it difficult to reach any equivalent conclusion in relative sensitivities. As such, existing modelling-based risk assessments may have substantially underestimated the scale of the problem in Asia through use of North American derived dose\textendash{}response relationships.},

  abstract = {Global freshwater assessments tend to focus primarily on water flow in perennial rivers, lakes, and groundwater, so called blue water in the hydrological cycle. Little attention is paid to the role of green water, or vapour flows, in sustaining the generation of terrestrial ecosystem services, including biomass production. Ecosystem services (such as carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, pollination and pest control) are generated by ecological processes in different biomes of the World and essential for socio-economic development. In this paper we critically assess the limitations of the past blue water bias for future ecohydrological landscape management. We present results from an effort of quantifying continental green water fluxes for major terrestrial biomes indicating that the large biomes, generating essential ecosystem services depend on more than 90 \% of the total average terrestrial return flow of green water to the atmosphere. The paper discusses the future implications of such large dependence on green water fluxes, and options of improving efficiency in water resources management. It points at the need of avoiding sectoral management and calls for an ecohydrological landscape management based on both ecological and hydrological knowledge.},

  abstract = {We extend the concept of `Weather Value at Risk' \textendash{} initially introduced to measure the economic risks resulting from current weather fluctuations \textendash{} to describe and compare sectoral income risks from climate change. This is illustrated using the examples of wheat cultivation and summer tourism in (parts of) Sardinia. Based on climate scenario data from four different regional climate models we study the change in the risk of weather-related income losses between some reference (1971\textendash{}2000) and some future (2041\textendash{}2070) period. Results from both examples suggest an increase in weather-related risks of income losses due to climate change, which is somewhat more pronounced for summer tourism. Nevertheless, income from wheat cultivation is at much higher risk of weather-related losses than income from summer tourism, both under reference and future climatic conditions. A weather-induced loss of at least 5\% \textendash{} compared to the income associated with average reference weather conditions \textendash{} shows a 40\% (80\%) probability of occurrence in the case of wheat cultivation, but only a 0.4\% (16\%) probability of occurrence in the case of summer tourism, given reference (future) climatic conditions. Whereas in the agricultural example increases in the weather-related income risks mainly result from an overall decrease in average wheat yields, the heightened risk in the tourism example stems mostly from a change in the weather-induced variability of tourism incomes. With the extended `Weather Value at Risk' concept being able to capture both, impacts from changes in the mean and the variability of the climate, it is a powerful tool for presenting and disseminating the results of climate change impact assessments. Due to its flexibility, the concept can be applied to any economic sector and therefore provides a valuable tool for cross-sectoral comparisons of climate change impacts, but also for the assessment of the costs and benefits of adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {The mineralization/immobilization of nitrogen when organic sources are added to soil is represented in many simulation models as the outcome of decomposition of the added material and synthesis of soil organic matter. These models are able to capture the pattern of N release that is attributable to the N concentration of plant materials, or more generally the C:N ratio of the organic input. However, the models are unable to simulate the more complex pattern of N release that has been observed for some animal manures, notably materials that exhibit initial immobilization of N even when the C:N of the material suggests it should mineralize N. The APSIM SoilN module was modified so that the three pools that constitute added organic matter could be specified in terms of both the fraction of carbon in each pool and also their C:N ratios (previously it has been assumed that all pools have the same C:N ratio). It is shown that the revised model is better able to simulate the general patterns on N mineralized that has been reported for various organic sources. By associating the model parameters with measured properties (the pool that decomposes most rapidly equates with water-soluble C and N; the pool that decomposes slowest equates with lignin-C) the model performed better than the unmodified model in simulating the N mineralization from a range of feeds and faecal materials measured in an incubation experiment.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty in parameters characterising different land covers leads to uncertainty in model predictions of land use change effects. In this study, a new approach is presented which allows a model to be assessed to see whether it is suitable for investigating land use change scenarios in the sense that different land covers can be significantly distinguished in their effects on model output. It consists of the following steps: (a) The uncertainty in land cover-dependent parameters is quantified. (b) The model of an artificial catchment with representative characteristics and uniform land cover is established. (c) Using this artificial catchment, Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to determine the uncertainty in the model response to different land covers. (d) By comparing the results for two covers, respectively, a dimensionless test statistic, the distinction level, is calculated. The distinction level is a normalised probability that two independent realisations of land covers which are parameterised within their range of natural uncertainty will yield distinct model responses. If the distinction level is greater than or equal to 90\%, the land covers are assumed to have a significantly different effect on the model output. An example of the application of the new method is provided using the eco-hydrologic model SWAT-G. The land covers forest, pasture and arable land can be significantly distinguished by their long-term means of surface runoff, groundwater recharge and streamflow. The minimum proportion of the catchment area on which land cover must change in order to obtain significantly distinct model responses depends on the land covers involved and the considered hydrologic variable. In the case of a change between pasture and forest and with regard to average streamflow, this minimum proportion amounts to about 25\%, a value that compares well with the results of paired catchment studies.},

This paper attempts to provide an overview of the present state of crop modelling to assess climate change risks to food production and to which extent crop models comply with IAM demands. Considerable progress has been made in modelling effects of climate variables, where crop models best satisfy IAM demands. Demands are partly satisfied for simulating commonly required assessment variables. However, progress on the number of simulated crops, uncertainty propagation related to model parameters and structure, adaptations and scaling are less advanced and lagging behind IAM demands. The limitations are considered substantial and apply to a different extent to all crop models. Overcoming these limitations will require joint efforts, and consideration of novel modelling approaches.},

  shorttitle = {Severity\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency curves in the mitigation of drought impact},
  doi = {10.1007/s11069-012-0446-4},
  abstract = {Severity\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency (SDF) curves are very useful in the analysis of drought phenomena. Station-level information obtained from SDF curves can be interpolated to obtain severity maps for fixed return period, in order to jointly analyse the spatial variability of drought characteristics (e.g. severity, duration and frequency). This approach is limited because the severity is usually quantified through indices that use hydrological and meteorological data, depending on the type of requirements. Therefore, drought indices can only reflect hydrological conditions, but are unable to quantify economic losses associated with droughts. In other words, SDF curves do not allow effective quantification of the impact expected with a certain return period. This paper proposes the methodology drought economic risk assessment (DERA) as an approach that emphasizes the importance of the relationship between a generic drought index (which quantifies water deficit) and the economic impact of the failure to meet water demand. Using integrated SDF curves, this relationship enables drought severity and corresponding impacts to be mapped. This procedure was applied to agricultural droughts (sunflower crop) in Umbria Region (central Italy). The agricultural drought impact variable was identified by sunflower yield (Y); the economic impact variable by net benefit depletion (EL); and the drought index by Relative Severity Index (RSI), which is quantifiable by a soil\textendash{}water balance model. The relationships Y = g(RSI) and EL = f(Y) were specifically determined. Using DERA, it was possible to derive curves for SDF, impact\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency, and economic losses\textendash{}duration\textendash{}frequency (ELDF), which were then used to map severity, impact and economic losses for the assigned return period and duration. From the ELDF curves, further information was obtained by mapping critical drought durations for the assigned return period and economic loss threshold. The case study supports the potential of the proposed approach, both in the planning and real-time management of drought effects.},

  abstract = {With the current water shortage in East Africa improving crop water use is vital especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of Ethiopia. To understand the response of barley to water and to simulate the biomass and grain yield of barley under various water inputs and planting dates, we tested the FAO AquaCrop model versions 3.0 using independent data sets during the cropping seasons of 2006, 2008 and 2009 at Mekelle site in northern Ethiopia. We found that the model is valid to simulate the barley biomass and grain yield under various planting dates in the study site. AquaCrop model can be used in the evaluation of optimal planting time. Out of the tested planting dates, planting on July 4 (early sowing) was found to maximize barley biomass, grain and water use efficiency. The model can also be used in the evaluation of irrigation strategies. Barley showed slightly lower performance under mild water stress condition compared to full irrigation condition. However, the model has indicated the possibility of obtaining more biomass and grain yield from a relatively larger barley field under (deficit irrigation) mild stress condition.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.envsoft.2013.09.002},
  abstract = {A novel geospatial tool box named Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim) has been developed, which can be used to manage point-based model simulations at multiple locations using geospatial data within a geographic information system (GIS). The objectives of this paper were to describe GeoSim and demonstrate its use. GeoSim has been developed as a plug-in for Quantum GIS, and both of these software programs are open-source and freely available. An important feature of GeoSim is its model-independent nature, meaning any point-based simulation model that uses ASCII files for input and output can be managed spatially. GeoSim facilitates the transfer of geospatial data from the GIS database to the model input files and from the model output files back to the GIS database. GeoSim presently includes six software tools, each with a graphical user interface. A case study demonstrates the use of GeoSim for processing geospatial data layers at a field site, conducting spatial model simulations, and optimizing model parameters for site-specific conditions. Two cropping system models, AquaCrop and the DSSAT Cropping System Model, were implemented to simulate seed cotton yield in response to irrigation management, nitrogen management, and soil texture variability for a 14 ha study area near Lamesa, Texas. Geoprocessing tools within GeoSim were able to summarize 5592 data points within 405 polygon features in 3.8 s. Simulation tools were able to swap 33,316 and 44,550 parameters values to complete 405 spatial simulations with the AquaCrop and DSSAT models in 112 s and 398 s, respectively. These results demonstrate the utility of GeoSim for summarizing large geospatial data sets and transferring the data to the file formats of multiple models. Simulation duration was increased as compared to stand-alone model simulations without parameter swapping, which may be problematic for applications requiring large numbers of simulations. The flexible design of GeoSim is intended to support spatial modeling exercises for a variety of models and environmental applications.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00271-014-0444-2},
  abstract = {This paper reports on a study combining experimental field data with biophysical crop modelling to assess the impacts of irrigation heterogeneity on onion yield. The AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for brown onion (cv Arthur) and used to simulate yield variability under a set of contrasting soil and agroclimatic conditions assuming perfect (100 \% uniform) irrigation. The impacts of non-uniform irrigation as measured on-farm under two overhead systems (mobile hose reel fitted with boom and a linear move) were then evaluated using scenario analysis and multi-model runs. Stochastic modelling confirmed that the lowest yield (8.6 t DM/ha) occurs on the lowest moisture retentive soils under the driest agroclimatic conditions with non-uniform irrigation. There is much greater yield variability in dry years compared to wet years. In wet years, rainfall reduces the scheduled number of irrigation events and buffers the effects of irrigation non-uniformity on yield. Yields were more variable under the mobile hose reel system fitted with the boom compared to the fixed linear move system. The modelled yield variability under non-uniform was similar to the observed yields reported by growers based on an industry survey. The study highlights the importance of achieving high irrigation uniformity in dry years on light soils to maximise yield and provides useful data for evaluating the potential yield benefits that might accrue from precision irrigation.},

  abstract = {In the dry areas, water, not land, is the most limiting resource for improved agricultural production. Maximizing water productivity, and not yield per unit of land, is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a highly efficient practice with great potential for increasing agricultural production and improving livelihoods in the dry rainfed areas. In the drier environments, most of the rainwater is lost by evaporation; therefore the rainwater productivity is extremely low. Water harvesting can improve agriculture by directing and concentrating rainwater through runoff to the plants and other beneficial uses. It was found that over 50\% of lost water can be recovered at a very little cost. However, socioeconomic and environmental benefits of this practice are far more important than increasing agricultural water productivity. This paper highlights the major research findings regarding improving water productivity in the dry rainfed region of West Asia and North Africa. It shows that substantial and sustainable improvements in water productivity can only be achieved through integrated farm resources management. On-farm water-productive techniques if coupled with improved irrigation management options, better crop selection and appropriate cultural practices, improved genetic make-up, and timely socioeconomic interventions will help to achieve this objective. Conventional water management guidelines should be revised to ensure maximum water productivity instead of land productivity.},

  abstract = {Ecophysiological models for interplant competition were first developed in the early 1980s to obtain a better understanding of the harmful effect of weeds on crop productivity. The models were developed from simulation models of monoculture crops; each competing species was represented by its own growth model, which were then linked by additional routines to account for the distribution of resources over competing species. Initially the models were used for the construction of more robust damage relationships to support rational decision making on the use of herbicides. At present, apart from a need to reduce the use of herbicides, the design of weed management systems with a reduced reliance on herbicides is advocated. As a result, the weed problem should be envisaged in a different perspective. Rather than focusing only on detrimental effects in current crops, main emphasis should shift towards the management of weed populations and weed management itself should become an integrated component of crop management. For the development of these alternative management systems, specific improvements with respect to prevention, alternative control technology and decision making seem promising. The new challenges for modeling crop\textendash{}weed interactions and prerequisites for crop\textendash{}weed competition models that follow from these developments are discussed.},

  abstract = {Deterministic crop growth models require several inputs relating to crop/variety, soil physical properties, weather and crop management. The input values used could be significantly uncertain due to random and systematic measurement errors and spatial and temporal variation observed in many of these inputs. Often soil and weather data are approximated using GIS and/or weather generators. In this paper total uncertainty in simulated yield, evapotranspiration and crop N uptake has been quantified considering uncertainties in crop, soil and weather inputs. WTGROWS, a crop model that simulates the effect of genotypic, climatic, edaphic and management factors on productivity of spring wheat was used. The uncertainty in each input was represented by a statistical distribution of values based on literature review, actual measurement and subjective expert judgement. The Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to analyze total uncertainty. The results showed that uncertainties in crop, soil and weather inputs resulted in uncertainty in simulated grain yield, ET and N uptake, which varied depending upon the production environment. Uncertainties in outputs increased as the production system changed from a potential production level to a level where crop growth was constrained by limited availability of water and nitrogen. There was an 80\% probability that the bias in the deterministic model outputs was always less than 10\% in potential and irrigated production systems. In rainfed environments this bias was larger. The bias in simulated outputs was less than or equal to model error. Most of the uncertainty in outputs caused by variable soil, crop and weather inputs could be represented if the outputs were determined using fixed soil and crop data, and a large series of weather data. In potential and irrigated production systems, inputs relating to crop photosynthesis and leaf area estimation had a large `uncertainty importance'. Uncertainties in soil N inputs and vapor pressure were also of great importance in irrigated environments. In rainfed environments, uncertainties in soil and weather inputs were dominant and crop parameters had only limited `uncertainty importance'. The implications of these results in estimates of potential and rainfed productivity, database development and guiding refinement of models are discussed.},

It provides a quantitative basis to compare underutilised crop productivity and resource-use-efficiency with that of major crops and cropping systems under current and future climate scenarios, and will include interactive tools to integrate underutilised crop data with geo-referenced information in existing and new databases. Specific crop application models form the analysis engine of CropBASE, including crop-climate, crop-quality, crop-economic models to assess agroecological suitability, nutritional value, livelihood or food security potential of underutilised crops and products at field, farm and regional scales. A geospatial information system framework will link currently available climate databases as input data for crop models. CFFRC, already using major models for a range of crops around the world under the AgMIP program, will spearhead the inclusion of specific underutilised crops into recognised crop models. After briefly introducing CropBASE, this paper presents use cases as examples comparing yield and water productivity predictions for bambara groundnut (an underutilised African legume) and pearl millet (an alternative major cereal) under current and future climate scenarios in contrasting sub-Saharan African locations.},
